Research on Young Single and Multiple Stars
Faculty Member: Michal Simon

I regularly involve qualified undergraduates in my research on the
formation and evolution of stars.  Depending on the nature of the
project and the student this participation has taken the form of
enrollment in a research course, paid work as a research aide, or some
more informal arrangement.  Sometimes the research leads to a
publication, as in M. Simon and R. C. Obbie, AJ, 137, 3442 (2009)
and T. Kataria and M. Simon, AJ 140, 206, (2010).
