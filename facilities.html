	      <P><h2>Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)</h2>

		Stony Brook University is part of
		the <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/act/">Atacama
		  Cosmology Telescope (ACT)</a> Collaboration.  ACT is a
		six-metre telescope on Cerro Toco in the Atacama
		Desert in the north of Chile. It is designed to make
		high-resolution, millimeter-wavelength surveys of the
		sky in order to study the cosmic microwave background
		radiation (CMB).  The main goals of this project are
		to measure the parameters that describe the early
		Universe and to map out the cosmic growth of
		structure.


	      <P><h2>Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)</h2>

	      <P>
		<div class="fac_leftw">

		  Scientist Morgan May (left) and SBU Astronomer Fred
		  Walter (right) at an LSST meeting
		</div>

	      <p>The <a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/">Large
		  Synoptic Survey Telescope</a> (LSST) is a $500
		million telescope that will image half the night sky
		every three days.  LSST will see objects that are
		400-million times fainter than those we can see with
		the naked eye. The data stream that will be
		generated is far greater than any astronomical
		endeavor to date, at about 30 terabytes per
		night. This instrument will become operational in
		2020, and it will revolutionize all fields of
		astronomy.

	      <p><a href="http://www.bnl.gov/LSST/">Brookhaven
		  National Lab</a> (BNL) has been a partner institution
		in LSST for almost a decade, has a major role in the
		development of the LSST camera, and has built up a
		small Cosmology group to extract science from the
		LSST.  Several faculty at Stony Brook are members of
		the LSST collaboration, and actively partner with LSST
		scientists at BNL to lay the theoretical,
		computational, and instrumental groundwork to enable
		the LSST science goals.

	      <P><h2>SMARTS telescopes</h2> Stony Brook University is
		one of the founding members of
		the <A HREF="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/fwalter/SMARTS/smarts.html">SMARTS</A>
		consortium. The SMARTS consortium was organized to
		keep open and operating
		the <a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/~whiting/smartspix.html">small
		  telescopes</a> at
		the <a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/">Cerro Tololo
		  Interamerican Observatory</a>. The prime source of
		information about SMARTS is
		the <a href="http://www.astro.yale.edu/smarts/">main
		  SMARTS web page</a> at Yale university.


	      <P><h2>Mount Stony Brook</h2> 

		<div class="fac_right">
		  <img src="images/meade2.png" ALT="Mt. Stony Brook Meade"><br>
		  the 14&quot; telescope
		</div>

		The <A href="/astro/mtstonybrook">Mount Stony Brook
		  Observatory</A> consists of a new computerized Meade
		14 inch LX200-ACF telescope permanently mounted in a
		dome on the roof of our building.  We have 2 CCD
		cameras (+ filter wheel) and a spectrograph that can
		be used with it, as well as an assortment of
		eyepieces.  The telescope is currently used for
		graduate and undergraduate classes and labs and
		during
		our <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/openight/opennite.html">Astronomy
		  Open Nights</a>.  Additionally, a large number of
		smaller 8&quot; telescopes are also available for
		use.


	      <p>The roof of the ESS building is designed for moderate
		sized crowds (~50 people), and students in the
		introductory undergraduate astronomy courses are
		frequently invited up for viewing.



	      <P><h2>Ground-Based Observatories</h2>

		Stony Brook astronomers make regular use of the wide
		array of instrumentation available to contemporary
		astronomy. Stony Brook faculty and graduate students
		are frequent users of the facilities of
		the <a href="http://www.noao.edu/">National Optical
		  Astronomy Observatories</a> such as
		the <a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/">Cerro Tololo
		  Interamerican Observatory</a>,
		the <a href="http://www.nrao.edu/">National Radio
		  Astronomy Observatories</a>, the NASA
		<a href="http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/">Infrared
		  Telescope Facility (IRTF)</a> on Mauna Kea,
		the <a href="http://www.nofs.navy.mil/projects/npoi/">Naval
		  Prototype Optical Interferometer (NPOI)</a>,
		the <a href="http://www.gemini.edu/">Gemini</a>, <a href="http://www.keckobservatory.org/">Keck</a>,
		the <a href="http://www.chara.gsu.edu/CHARA/">CHARA
		  Array</a>, <a href="http://iram.fr/">IRAM</a>
		observatories, the
		<a href="http://www.mmarray.org/">Combined Array for
		  Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA)</a>,
		the <a href="http://www.nro.nao.ac.jp/index-e.html">Nobeyama
		  45m telescope</a>, and
		the <a href="http://www.naoj.org/">Subaru
		  telescope</a>.


	      <P><h2>Space Missions</h2>

		Stony Brook faculty have been principal investigators
		on programs using
		the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources/">Hubble
		  Space Telescope (HST)</a>,
		the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/chandra/">Chandra
		  X-ray
		  Observatory</a>, <a href="http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/">XMM-Newton
		  X-ray
		  Observatory</a>, <a href="http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=16">Herschel
		  telescope</a> and
		the <a href="http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/">Spitzer
		  Space Telescope</a>.  Faculty and students routinely
		use archival data from these and other NASA missions
		in the course of their research. Graduate students
		routinely participate in analysis of data obtained
		from these and other missions, and use these data in
		the PhD theses.

		<P><h2>Local Computing Facilities</h2> 

		  The department maintains computing facilities,
		  consisting of UNIX workstations and Linux PCs, for
		  support of data analysis and theoretical work.
		  Profs. Swesty and Zingale have small beowulf
		  clusters for research.  In addition the University
		  has a 470 processor
		  cluster, <A HREF="http://www.stonybrook.edu/seawulfcluster/">Seawulf</A>
		  available for graduate student use.  Stony Brook
		  also is part of the New York Center for
		  Computational Science and together with Brookhaven
		  National Lab run a large IBM Blue Gene/L machine
		  (&gt; 36,000
		  processors), <A HREF="http://www.bnl.gov/newyorkblue/">New
		    York Blue</A>.

		<p>More details can be found on
		  the <a href="./localcomputing.html">Astronomy Group
		    Local Computing page</a>

		<P><h2>National Supercomputer Centers</h2>

		  Stony Brook researchers have large allocations of
		  supercomputer time (10s of million of CPU-hours per
		  year) at
		  the <A HREF="http://www.nersc.gov/">National Energy
		  Research Scientific Computing Center</A>,
		  the <A href="http://www.olcf.ornl.gov/">Oak Ridge
		  Leadership Computing Facility</A> (through the
		  INCITE program), and the
		  <A href="http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/bluewaters">NCSA
		    Blue Waters</a> machine through NSF.  These
		    computers are used mainly for simulations of
		    supernovae (Type Ia and II), X-ray bursts, and
		    other stellar explosions.
