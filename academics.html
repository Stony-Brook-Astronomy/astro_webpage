		<h2>Undergraduate Program</h2>
		<span class="byline">Astronomy undergraduates are
		heavily involved in research, working one-on-one with
		faculty.</span>
	      </header>

	      <p>We offer undergraduate majors and minors in
		Astronomy.  Courses taken by undergraduate Astronomy
		majors are characterized by their small size, rarely
		are enrollments over 10, and their intimate
		character. Instruction and learning take place in
		nearly optimal circumstances. Graduates of the program
		go on to the best graduate programs or are very
		competitive for technical positions in industry.

	      <p>Details of the program are provided by in the
		official Undergraduate Bulletin.  Links to the
		relevant parts are provided below.

	      <p>Details and <i>websites for individual courses</i> are provided in
		the <a
		      href="http://www.physics.sunysb.edu/Physics/undergrad/NewUGcourses.php">full
		  list of undergraduate courses</a> offered by the department.

	      <p>Each semester, we award
		the <a href="http://www.physics.sunysb.edu/Physics/awards/Award%20Feingold.pdf">Feingold
		  Prize in Introductory Astronomy</a> to the best student in each of the
		3 introduction classes we offer (AST 101, 105, and 248).</p>

		<h2>Graduate Program</h2>
		<span class="byline">Graduate students work toward a
		  PhD in Physics, doing research in our group.</span>
	      </header>


	      <p>The Graduate Program currently has about 10-15
		M.S. and Ph.D. students actively working in
		Astronomical research areas, and adds three to five
		new students each year. The emphasis is on a rigorous
		program of study and research in astrophysics leading
		to the Ph.D. degree, but we also offer opportunities
		for students with educational goals culminating at the
		master's level. Students follow a course of study that
		is both broadly based and topical, and are encouraged
		to participate in research with the faculty from the
		beginning of their graduate careers. Stony Brook's
		Astronomy Program is distinguished by the number of
		Ph.D. students who have taken positions at
		universities and research laboratories around the
		world.

	      <p>The first two years of the graduate program
		emphasizes coursework but also includes research or
		individual study courses in which the student works
		closely with a faculty member, often on a potential
		thesis topic. Upon completion of the courses, the
		student takes a qualifying examination for the
		master's degree and/or for candidacy for the
		Ph.D. degree. The Ph.D. candidate, together with a
		faculty adviser, then develops a topic for thesis
		research. Students may elect either theoretical or
		observational subjects, according to their own and
		their advisor's interests. Average time from entrance
		into graduate school to completion of the Ph.D. degree
		is five and a half years.

	      <p>Students take courses in physics and astronomy.  In
		addition to the standard sequence of astronomy course
		(Stars, Interstellar Medium, Galaxies, and Cosmology),
		specialized courses and seminars are offered.

	      <p>Details and <b>websites for individual courses</b>
		are provided in
		the <a href="http://graduate.physics.sunysb.edu/Physics_Courses.html">full
		list of graduate courses</a> offered by the
		department.

	      <p>Detailed requirements for the Graduate Program in
		Physics and Astronomy are available at
		the <A HREF="http://graduate.physics.sunysb.edu/">Departmental
		Web Page</A> as well as directions on how to contact
		us.
