		<h2>Undergraduate Program</h2>
		<span class="byline">Astronomy undergraduates are
		heavily involved in research, working one-on-one with
		faculty.</span>
	      </header>

	      <p>We offer undergraduate majors and minors in
		Astronomy.  Courses taken by undergraduate Astronomy
		majors are characterized by their small size, rarely
		are enrollments over 10, and their intimate
		character. Instruction and learning take place in
		nearly optimal circumstances. Graduates of the program
		go on to the best graduate programs or are very
		competitive for technical positions in industry.

	      <p>Details of the program are provided by in the
		official Undergraduate Bulletin.  Links to the
		relevant parts are provided below.

	      <p><h2>The AST Program</h2>
		<p><ul>

	      <p><h2>Upper-level Writing Requirement</h2>

                <p><ul>

                    <li><p>Each AST major must submit <b>2</b> papers for
                  the upper-level writing requirement.  The goal of
                  the upper level writing requirement is that you can
                  research an idea and present a discussion of it in
                  your own words.</li>

                    <li><p><em>Lab reports:</em>
                      The standard ("canned") AST 443 labs do not
                      facilitate this goal, since the background work
                      is already done for you.  As a result, we will
                      not accept upper level writing reports based on
                      those standard labs.  However, in that class you
                      also have the opportunity to write your own
                      observing proposal, which is an independent
                      creative work, and if selected, do the lab on
                      this.  We will accept an expanded version of
                      that lab for consideration of the upper level
                      writing requirement -- but only for the
                      individual who wrote the original proposal.</li>

                    <li>Common ways to satisfy the upper level writing
                    requirement include using a research paper from
                    another upper-level AST class, writing up a
                    summary of research you have been doing with
                    faculty on campus, or picking a topic of interest
                    to you and researching it and writing up a paper
                    describing the state of that field.</li>
                  </ul>

	      <p><h2>Feingold Prize</h2>


	      <p><ul><li>Each semester, we award
		the <a href="http://www.physics.sunysb.edu/Physics/awards/Award%20Feingold.pdf">Feingold
		  Prize in Introductory Astronomy</a> to the best student in each of the
		3 introduction classes we offer (AST 101, 105, and 248).</li></ul>


	      <p><header class="major">
		<h2>Graduate Program</h2>
		<span class="byline">Graduate students work toward a
		  PhD in Physics, doing research in our group.</span>
	      </header>


	      <p>The Graduate Program currently has about 10-15
		M.S. and Ph.D. students actively working in
		Astronomical research areas, and adds three to five
		new students each year. The emphasis is on a rigorous
		program of study and research in astrophysics leading
		to the Ph.D. degree, but we also offer opportunities
		for students with educational goals culminating at the
		master's level. Students follow a course of study that
		is both broadly based and topical, and are encouraged
		to participate in research with the faculty from the
		beginning of their graduate careers. Stony Brook's
		Astronomy Program is distinguished by the number of
		Ph.D. students who have taken positions at
		universities and research laboratories around the
		world.

	      <p>The first two years of the graduate program
		emphasizes coursework but also includes research or
		individual study courses in which the student works
		closely with a faculty member, often on a potential
		thesis topic. Upon completion of the courses, the
		student takes a qualifying examination for the
		master's degree and/or for candidacy for the
		Ph.D. degree. The Ph.D. candidate, together with a
		faculty adviser, then develops a topic for thesis
		research. Students may elect either theoretical or
		observational subjects, according to their own and
		their advisor's interests. Average time from entrance
		into graduate school to completion of the Ph.D. degree
		is five and a half years.

	      <p>Students take courses in physics and astronomy.  In
		addition to the standard sequence of astronomy course
		(Stars, Interstellar Medium, Galaxies, and Cosmology),
		specialized courses and seminars are offered.

	      <p>Details and <b>websites for individual courses</b>
		are provided in
		the <a href="http://graduate.physics.sunysb.edu/Physics_Courses.html">full
		list of graduate courses</a> offered by the
		department.

	      <p>Detailed requirements for the Graduate Program in
		Physics and Astronomy are available at
		the <A HREF="http://graduate.physics.sunysb.edu/">Departmental
		Web Page</A> as well as directions on how to contact
		us.
