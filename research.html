		      <a HREF="https://sibirrer.github.io/"><b>Simon Birrer's</b></a>
				research focus is to probe fundamental physics on cosmological scales.
				Birrer and his group are primary using gravitational lensing,
				a phenomena described by general relativity, causing light to follow
				curved paths when traveling through inhomogeneous matter distributions.
				In the strongest regime, gravitational lensing can lead to multiple
				appearances of the same source and highly distorts images -
				know as strong gravitational lensing (see image).
				Birrer’s scientific expertise is the interface between the exquisite
				data sets available on one side and the fundamental theory predictions
				on the other side. Birrer’s group is actively developing open-source
				advanced computational and statistical tools to extract detailed and
				robust information from strong lensing about the nature of dark matter
				and dark energy.

                      Will Farr's research centers on the new field of
                      gravitational wave astronomy.  He focuses
                      primarily on gravitaitonal wave signals from the
                      inspiral and merging of pairs of compact objects
                      &mdash; neutron stars or black holes.  He

		    <h3>Jin Koda</h3>
		    <span>
		      <img src="images.new/koda_m51.png" alt="koda"><br>

		      The primary goal
		      of <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/koda/"><b>Jin
			  Koda's</b></a> research is to understand the
		      gas dynamical evolution of galactic disks,
		      with an emphasis on star formation and
		      interstellar medium (ISM) evolution. He
		      employs both observational and theoretical
		      approaches to explore gas structure,
		      dynamics, and star formation over galactic
		      disks.

		      Jin Koda uses numerical hydrodynamic
		      simulations and predicts the dramatic
		      evolution of ISM structures in galactic
		      dynamics (e.g. Wada & Koda 2004). The growth
		      of such structures triggers star formation,
		      controlling the formation and evolution of
		      galactic disks. He also observes the
		      evolutionary links among dynamics, ISM
		      structures, and star formation. Recent and
		      upcoming instruments are providing exciting
		      opportunities in resolving ISM structures
		      over global galactic disks. The figure shows
		      an example -- a new image of molecular gas
		      in the Whirlpool galaxy M51 observed with
		      the Combined Array for Research in
		      Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) and Nobeyama
		      45m telescope (NRO45). This new map reveals
		      the ISM evolution driven by galactic
		      dynamics: strong shear motions on spiral
		      arms pull apart massive molecular gas
		      associations as they cross the spiral arms,
		      producing filamentary/spur structures in
		      interarm regions (Koda et al. 2009). He is
		      now leading the CARMA & NRO45 survey of
		      nearby galaxies to establish more general
		      picture of ISM evolution and star formation
		      in galaxies. He is also a member of the
		      Herschel key science project (KINGFISH --
		      Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: a
		      Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel), which
		      will unveil the immediate sites of star
		      formation that are hidden deeply in the
		      dense ISM.

		      <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/lattimer/"><b>Jim
			Lattimer</b></a> studies the structure,
			composition, formation and evolution of
			neutron stars by working at the crossroads
			between nuclear theory and astrophysics.  He
			also researches gravitational collapse
			supernovae, the mergers of neutron
			star-neutron star and neutron star-black hole
			binaries, and neutrino emission from
			proto-neutron stars.  He is interested in the
			nuclear matter equation of state and the
			constraints that can be placed on it by
			laboratory nuclear measurements as well as by
			pulsar-timing observations and optical and
			X-ray studies of neutron stars.  He has
			published, and continues to develop, tabulated
			equations of state that are frequently used
			throughout the world in large-scale
			computational simulations of supernovae and
			neutron star mergers.<br>

		        This figure shows the experimentally
		        constrained region of parameter space for
		        symmetry energy coefficients, showing
		        remarkable agreement with neutron matter
		        theory and astrophysical measurements from
		        neutron stars.  The nuclear constraints come
		        from nuclear binding energies, dipole
		        polarizabilities, giant dipole resonance
		        energies, and neutron skin thickenesses, and
		        from the composition of fragments in heavy ion
		        collisions.  The astrophysical measurements
		        come from neutron star X-ray bursts and from
		        thermal radiation from of recently-accreting
		        and now-cooling neutron stars in binary
		      systems.

		      Loverde</a></b> is a theoretical astrophysicist
		      working in cosmology. Her primary interests are
		      developing tools to use astrophysical datasets
		      to learn about the fundamental physics of dark
		      matter, dark energy, and inflation and to learn
		      about the history and evolution of structure in
		      the universe. She has worked extensively on weak
		      gravitational lensing in galaxy surveys,
		      primordial non-Gaussianity as a test of
		      inflation, and massive neutrinos in cosmology
		      (Image credit: Springel et al. 2005).

		    <h3>Rosalba Perna</h3>
		    <span>
		      <img src="images.new/Magnetar-3b-400.png" alt="Magnetar"><br>

		      <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/rosalba/"><b>Rosalba
			  Perna</b></a> is a theorist with eclectic
		      research interests, including gamma-ray
		      bursts, neutron stars, gravitational
		      lensing, accretion phenomenena, the growth
		      of supermassive black holes, foregrounds for
		      CMB experiments, axions, exoplanets.<br>

		      In the last few years, her research has
		      partly focused on using gamma-ray bursts as
		      cosmological tools, to probe the physical
		      conditions (i.e. metallicity, clumping, dust
		      content) in high-redshift galaxies, and to
		      put constraints on warm dark matter models
		      for structure formation.<br>

		      Another currently active line of research is
		      in the area of the so-called 'magnetars', a
		      class of neutron stars characterized by very
		      strong magnetic fields, on the order of
		      10<sup>14</sup>-10<sup>15</sup>G.  These are
		      the most intense fields ever measured in the
		      Universe.  As the magnetic field evolves in
		      the interior of these stars, magnetic
		      stresses can occasionally become strong
		      enough to break the crust, yielding
		      'starquakes', which trigger outbursts in
		      gamma and X-rays.  Rosalba's research aims
		      at understanding, by means of simulations of
		      the coupled thermal and magnetic field
		      evolution within the neutron star crust, the
		      role played by the magnetic field strength
		      and topology on the observed phenomenology
		      of these sources, and in particular on their
		      temperature and timing evolution, and on
		      their outburst statistics.<br>

		      present, he is most involved in using
		      dynamical methods to measure the masses of
		      young stars to measure the masses of very

                        where she is currently co-convener of the Clusters
                        working group, and a member of the Collaboration
                        Council.  von der Linden is also interested in the
                        physics of galaxy clusters, such as the dynamics of
                        merging clusters, as well as the properties and
                        evolution of cluster galaxies.

		      <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/fwalter/"><b>Fred
			  Walter</b></a> has eclectic interests in
		      galactic astronomy.  His main interests are
		      in star formation in the Galaxy, stellar
		      coronae and chromospheres, and compact
		      objects. The overarching theme to his
		      present research is the astrophysics of
		      accretion, from star formation (T Tauri
		      stars), to white dwarfs (polars and novae).
		      He is a multiwavelength observer, working in
		      X-rays (Chandra and XMM), UV (FUSE), optical
		      (HST; SMARTS) and the near-IR (IRTF).
		      Current projects include: Accretion and
		      activity in the T Tauri stars S CrA and RU
		      Lupi, The eruptive pre-main sequence stars
		      (EXORs) V1118 Ori and V1647 Ori,
		      Spectrophotometry of recent novae, including
		      YY Dor and N LMC 2005, Coronal structure in
		      rapidly rotating stars: XY UMa and V471 Tau,
		      Star formation in OB associations,
		      concentrating on the low mass stars and
		      brown dwarfs in the Orion OB1 association,
		      properties of isolated neutron stars,
		      activity cycles in magnetic cataclysmic
		      variables (POLARS)

		      <a href="https://zingale.github.io/"><b>Mike
			  Zingale</b></a> is interested in
		      computational and nuclear astrophysics, in
		      particular the development of computational
		      methods appropriate to modeling Type Ia
		      supernovae, Type I X-ray bursts, and
		      Classical novae.  Type Ia supernovae are the
		      largest thermonuclear explosions in the
		      Universe.  The physical processes leading up
		      to the explosion involve a wide range of
		      length and timescales, making these events
		      extremely challenging to simulate.  Working
		      with colleagues at LBL, Zingale has
		      developed a low Mach number hydrodynamic
		      code, <a href="http://boxlib-codes.github.io/MAESTRO/">Maestro</a> and compressible radiation hydrodynamics code, <a href="http://boxlib-codes.github.io/Castro/">Castro</a>.  Together these codes can model
		      both the subsonic and explosive phases that
		      arise in these system.

		      Maestro filters soundwaves from
		      the system, allowing for the efficient
		      simulation of long timescale processes, such
		      as astrophysical convection.  This method
		      was recently used
		      to <a href="https://zingale.github.io/simulations/wdconvect/">model the
			final hours of 'smoldering'</a> preceding
		      the explosion of a Type Ia supernovae.  This
		      type of calculation is critical to
		      determining the distribution of the initial
		      flames for the subsequent explosion.
		      Castro is the main code for our <a href="https://zingale.github.io/simulations/wdmerger/">merging white
		      dwarf</a> and <a href="https://zingale.github.io/simulations/xrb/">X-ray burst</a> studies.
		      Both codes are freely available for use.<br>

		      Together with other members of the nuclear
		      astrophysics group, Zingale is also
		      interested in verification and validation of
		      astrophysical hydrodynamics and radiation
		      hydrodynamics codes.
