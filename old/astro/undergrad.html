<p>The Astronomy group would like to increase interactions with our
undergraduate majors and minors.  This page lists resources (both
local and national) available to undergraduates with an interest in
astronomy.

<p>Information on the undergraduate major and minor can be found
on the <a href="academics.html">academics page</a>.

<H1>Astronomy Club</H1>

<p>There is a newly-formed <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/stonybrookastronomyclub
">undergraduate
astronomy club</a> that frequently meets to discuss astronomy and use
the rooftop telescope.  More information on the group's activities
can be found by clicking the link above.


<p>&nbsp;
<H1>Local Events of Interest to Astronomy Undergrads</H1>
<H2>Seminars and Journal Club</H2>

<p>Anyone with an interest in Astronomy is welcomed to attend our (semi-)weekly
<A HREF="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/koda/jc/jclub.html">Journal Club</A> and <A HREF="./seminars_share.html">Seminars</A>.

<p>In Journal Club, faculty, grad students, and sometimes
undergraduates present an overview of a recent research paper to the
rest of the Astronomy group.  There are typically 1-2 presentations
per week, and these are very informal.  This is a good way to learn
about the latest developments in all fields of Astronomy.

<p>For our Seminars, we bring guest speakers from around the country
to talk to us about their research.  Typically, we pick speakers with
research interests aligned with those of the different researchers in
our group.

<p>The current schedules for both Journal Club and Astronomy Seminars
can always be found from the links off the
main <a href="./events.html">events</a> portion of Astronomy group
webpage.


<H2>Colloquia</H2>

<p>Undergrads are also encouraged to attend the weekly <A
HREF="http://www.physics.sunysb.edu/Physics/calendar/colloquium.shtml">Physics
and Astronomy Departmental Colloquia</A>, every Tues. starting at
4:15pm in Harriman 137 (cookies and coffee begin at 3:45pm).  There
are typically several astronomy-related talks each semester.  (Don't 
worry if you don't understand everything in the talk&mdash;not all
the faculty present will either!  You will certainly pick up something
new from the talk.)


<p>&nbsp;
<H1>Local Research Opportunities</H1>

<P>There are often opportunities for undergraduates to participate in
research with local faculty.  This can be done informally, or for
major-credit.  

<P>The following faculty have indicated that they are interested in
working with undergraduates currently:

<table border=0 cellpadding=3px width="80%">
<tr class="gray"><td align="center"><b>&nbsp;faculty member&nbsp;</b></td>

<tr><td>Mike Zingale</td><td><A HREF="research_opportunities/zingale_research.txt">Computational Astrophysics</A></td>
</table>

<p>The Undergraduate Research and Creative Activites (URECA) program
  offers <A href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/ureca/ureca%20summer.shtml">financial support for summer research done at Stony Brook</a>.

<p>Also see the slides from our <a href="./townmeeting.pdf">annual town hall meeting</a> with the majors and minors.


<p>&nbsp;
<H1>Information About Applying to Grad School</H1>

There is a lot of information on the web about applying for graduate
schools.  Most schools will require the Physics GREs.  A lot of
resources for the exam (practice tests, tips, etc.) can be found by
searching online.  Below we list a few of them.

</dl>

<p>There are also a lot of resources to help with choosing a graduate
program.  Perhaps the best resource is to ask one of the Astronomy
faculty here at Stony Brook for advice.  About every 10 years, the
National Research Council ranks graduate programs, including Astronomy
and Astrophysics departments and Physics departments.  These rankings
can also be helpful when picking a school.

Research Council evaluations of graduate programs.  </dd>

<p>&nbsp;
<H1>External Research Opportunities</H1>

<P>There are a number of programs available for undergraduates interested
in doing summer research in astronomy.  Here we provide links to the 
application pages for these programs as they become available.

Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)</A></DT> 

<DD>The National Science Foundation (NSF) provides various astronomy
programs across the country with funding to provide paid summer
research internships for undergraduates.  This is a great opportunity
to spend your summer in another part of the country performing
astronomy research.  Note that the deadlines for applications are in
Dec/Jan for the following summer.
