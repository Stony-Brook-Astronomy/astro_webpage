        <b>Neelima Sehgal's</b></a> research focuses
        on using cosmological data to understand the nature of dark
        energy and dark matter, the properties of neutrinos, and the
        physics of the early Universe, including inflation.  This is
        done primarily using measurements of the Cosmic Microwave
        Background (CMB), and Stony Brook is actively involved in the
        ACTpol Collaboration, which measures the CMB from a
        ground-based telescope in the Atacama Desert in Chile.
        Neelima's group is primary interested in exploiting the
        gravitational lensing signal in the CMB to measure the mass of
        neutrinos, and in measuring the polarization signal in the CMB
        to look for signatures of inflation.

        <p>Neelima's group is also active in the Dark Energy Science
        Collaboration of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).
        In particular, they focus on using optical weak gravitational
        lensing to measure properties of dark energy and dark matter.

        The primary goal of <a
        href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/koda/"><b>Jin Koda's</b></a>
        research is to understand the gas dynamical evolution of
        galactic disks, with an emphasis on star formation and
        interstellar medium (ISM) evolution. He employs both
        observational and theoretical approaches to explore gas
        structure, dynamics, and star formation over galactic
        disks.</p>

        <p>Jin Koda uses numerical hydrodynamic simulations and
        predicts the dramatic evolution of ISM structures in galactic
        dynamics (e.g. Wada & Koda 2004). The growth of such
        structures triggers star formation, controlling the formation
        and evolution of galactic disks. He also observes the
        evolutionary links among dynamics, ISM structures, and star
        formation. Recent and upcoming instruments are providing
        exciting opportunities in resolving ISM structures over global
        galactic disks. The figure shows an example -- a new image of
        molecular gas in the Whirlpool galaxy M51 observed with the
        Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA)
        and Nobeyama 45m telescope (NRO45). This new map reveals the
        ISM evolution driven by galactic dynamics: strong shear
        motions on spiral arms pull apart massive molecular gas
        associations as they cross the spiral arms, producing
        filamentary/spur structures in interarm regions (Koda et
        al. 2009). He is now leading the CARMA & NRO45 survey of
        nearby galaxies to establish more general picture of ISM
        evolution and star formation in galaxies. He is also a member
        of the Herschel key science project (KINGFISH -- Key Insights
        on Nearby Galaxies: a Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel),
        which will unveil the immediate sites of star formation that
        are hidden deeply in the dense ISM.</p>

        Metchev's</b></a> research focuses on understanding the
        physical properties and the dynamical evolution of extrasolar
        planetary systems and of brown dwarfs - objects with
        intermediate characteristics between those of stars and gas
        giant planets. On one hand, he employs the high-contrast
        imaging capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope and of
        ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems
        to resolve dusty disks around young stars.  Spatially resolved
        images of such circumstellar disks allow us to study the
        formation and architectures of extrasolar planetary systems.
        On the other hand, he uses sensitive optical to infrared
        spectroscopy to characterize the atmospheres of brown dwarfs
        at all ages.  The chemical composition and physical structure
        of brown dwarf atmospheres are not unlike those of gas giant
        planets in the Solar System, and thus allow us to project the
        properties of extrasolar giant planets expected to be imaged
        in the next few years.</p>

        <p>Stan's research relies on archival and proprietary data
        from ground- and space-based telescopes, and uses state of the
        art technology, such as adaptive optics imaging, integral
        field spectroscopy, and large-scale database
        cross-correlation.  Research is done on a collaborative basis
        with scientists across the US and at international
        institutions, and will often involve students in additional
        on-site observations at mountain-top observatories.</p>

      specifically the <a
      href="http://www.nofs.navy.mil/projects/npoi/">Navy Prototype
      Optical Interferometer (NPOI)</a>, to image the disks of stars.
      Using this instrument, he and colleagues have resolved the
      rotationally distorted disk and specifically the asymmetric
      intensity distribution across the surface of the disk of Altair,
      one of the three bright A stars making up the so-called summer
      triangle.  He, along with the same colleagues have also
      discovered that Vega, another of the summer triangle and the
      principle spectral and photometric standard for Astronomy, is
      also rotating near breakup, albeit seen nearly pole-on.  This
      means that the wavelength dependence of Vega's emitted light
      will be substantially different than expected, which will
      materially affect its use as a standard.</p>

      <p>With planned upgrades, particularly increased baseline
      lengths, the NPOI is contributing to opening a whole new chapter
      in stellar astrophysics, including how stars accommodate to and
      evolve while undergoing extreme rotation, the appearance and
      evolution of sunspots on other solar type stars, the appearance
      of regions of variable composition on the surface of hotter, but
      slowly rotating stars, etc.  This is a period of rapid advances,
      observationally driven, in the area of stellar astrophysics.</p>

          <p>In the last few years, her research has partly focused on

          physical conditions (i.e. metallicity, clumping, dust

          <p>Another currently active line of research is in the area of
          the so-called 'magnetars', a class of neutron stars
          characterized by very strong magnetic fields, on the order
          of 10<sup>14</sup>-10<sup>15</sup>G.  These are the most intense fields ever
