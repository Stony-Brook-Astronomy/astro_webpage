Research on brown dwarfs
faculty member: Stan Metchev

I am looking for an undergraduate student interested in research on brown
dwarfs and giant planets.  In particular, I am looking for help in creating
a web database of all known and directly imaged brown dwarf and planetary
companions to stars.  The creation of such a database would be very timely
given the rapid development of the field of extrasolar planets, and the
final product can be presented by the student at national astronomy
meetings.  Knowledge of HTML would be a definite plus, but willingness to
learn and interest in the subject are of the highest importance.
