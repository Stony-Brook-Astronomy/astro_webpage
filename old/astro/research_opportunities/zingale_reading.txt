Reading Course on SNe Ia
faculty member: Michael Zingale

I am happy to serve as an adviser for a reading course on topics
involving thermonuclear supernovae (Type Ia supernovae).  This will be
for preferably 1 credit, but at most 2 credits per semester.  An
interested student should have taken some of the 300-level AST
courses, and received good grades throughout their AST courses.
