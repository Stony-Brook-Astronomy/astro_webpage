Models of Thermonuclear Flames with Large Reaction Networks
faculty members: Alan Calder and Michael Zingale

Profs. Alan Calder and Michael Zingale would be interested in working
with an advanced undergraduate on modeling thermonuclear flames in the
context of Type Ia supernova, using large reaction networks.  We wish
to explore the change in flame properties with metalicity as well as
understand how multi-stage reaction networks alter the behavior of
flame instabilities in multi-dimensions.  The interested undergraduate
should have programming experience (and have taken AST/PHY 277) and
should also have taken thermodynamics.
