	<h1>The Astronomy Computing Facility Usage Policy</h1>

	<!-- put information here -->
         By making use of any Astronomy Computing Facility systems, 
         including the web and mail servers, or 
         equipment connected to those systems, you are agreeing to the 
         Terms of Usage described below, as well as the all applicable
         Stony Brook University Policies and New York State Policies.  These
         policies include, but are not limited to, the 
         <a href="http://it.cc.stonybrook.edu/policies/">
          Stony Brook University Division of Information Technology 
          Policies</a> and the <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/astro/NewYorkStateAcceptableUseBestPracticeGuideline.pdf">
         NYS Information Technology Policy.pdf</a>

         
         <a href=#terms>here</a>

           <h3>Critical Note:</h3>
               We do not maintain backups of the <b>/home</b> directory.   
               <b>Backing up your data is your responsibility!</b>  You may
               find it useful to back up your data to DVD using the <b>k3b</b>
               DVD burner found on some of the systems.  Please see the system
               administrator if you require assistance. 

        <h2><a NAME=systems>ACF public systems available for login:</a></h2>
   

           <p>At the present time the following systems are available for
           use as a part of the ACF: 
           <ul> 
             <li>kirk.astro.sunysb.edu
             <li>spock.astro.sunysb.edu
             <li>scotty.astro.sunysb.edu
             <li>sulu.astro.sunysb.edu
             <li>klingon.astro.sunysb.edu
           </ul> 
           All of the aforementioned machines are running the 
           <a href="http://www.centos.org">CentOS 6</a> distribution
           of linux and they share the same
           /home directory and mail spool directory.  You may log into
           any of these systems using via secure shell, i.e. ssh, or 
           directly at the console in room 445B.


        <h2><a NAME=web>Web space:</a></h2> 

             All users with accounts on the ACF systems have web space
             on the Astro group web server at <a
             href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu">http://www.astro.sunysb.edu</a>
             This web space is available through the ACF public
             systems via the <b>/www</b> disk which is mounted on each
             system.  Each user has their own subdirectory on the
             <b>/www</b> disk with the path
             <b>/www/your_user_name</b>.  The URL for each user's web site
             is <b>http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/your_user_name</b> For
             example: a user with the username <b>inewton</b> would have a
             web directory at <b>/www/inewton</b> and their URL would 
             be <b>http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/inewton</b>   Please note that 
             there is no "~" in the URL.

        <h2><a NAME=email>Email:</a></h2> 
             The email disk, <b>/var/spool/mail</b> is cross-mounted on all of the
             public systems.   Each user of the ACF public systems should use 
             <b>your_user_name@mail.astro.sunysb.edu</b> as their reply-to address.
             Please DO NOT have mail sent directly to the individual systems, i.e. kirk, 
             spock, scotty, etc.   

             <p>You may forward your email to a system outside the
             ACF by placing an ASCII file named <b>.forward</b>, containing the 
             forwarding address on the first line, in your home directory.   Note
             that in order for this to work, the <b>.forward</b> file must not have 
             group or world write permissions enabled.   You can avoid this problem 
             by issuing the command <b>chmod og-w .forward</b> in your home directory. 

             <p> There are a number of email clients available including <b>kmail</b>, 
                 <b>thunderbird</b>, <b>mutt</b>, <b>alpine</b>, and <b>mail</b>.    
                 If you require assistance in configuring a specific
                 email client please see the system administrator.

             <h3>Special Note for pine users:</h3>
                 Users who wish to use the <b>pine</b> email client, which is unvailable
                 as a standard part of modern linux distributions because of licensing 
                 restrictions, should instead use <b>alpine</b>.
                 The <b>alpine</b> client  has been designed as a replacement for <b>pine</b>
                 and has the same user interface as <b>pine</b>.

                 <p>  When running alpine you may see a warning message about the fact that 
                  <b>alpine</b> in unable to obtain a lock on your <b>/var/spool/mail</b>
                  subdirectory.    You can safely ignore this warning if you follow precaution 1 below.
                  In order to protect the integrity of your email <b>alpine</b> users 
                  should take two special precautions:
                    <ol>
                       <li>  NEVER have more than one instance of <b>alpine</b> running at
                          one time on the public cluster.  For example:  DO NOT have 
                          one <b>alpine</b> session running on kirk and another simultaneously
                          running on scotty.   Having multiple simultaneous sessions could result
                          in a loss of mail.
                       <li>  YOU MUST ensure that <b>alpine</b> is configured to transfer mail
                          from your <b>/var/spool/mail</b> subdirectory into your home directory.
                          Using <b>/var/spool/mail</b> to store your mailbox is very bad idea as it 
                          is not backed up and/or may be lost during a system upgrade.   You can
                          cause <b>alpine</b> to transfer mail to your home directory (if it is not 
                          already doing so) by creating an empty file named <b>mbox</b> in your home
                          directory.   When <b>alpine</b> is opened it will automatically transfer
                          your mail to this file.   Please see the system administrator if you need
                          help in accomplishing this task.                          
                    </ol>

        <h2><a NAME=printing>Printing:</a></h2> 
             Printing on the printers in Rm. 445B is available for PostScript and
            text files on the ACF systems using the <b>lpr</b> command.   The default
            printer queue is the B&W duplex queue.   The queue may be specified by the command: 
            <b> lpr -P <queue_name></b> where <b>queue_name</b> is one of the following:
            <ul> 
               <li><b>hpk</b> the B&W simplex (single-sided) queue
               <li><b>hpdup</b> the B&W duplex (double-sided) queue
               <li><b>hpcolor</b> the color simplex (single-sided) queue
               <li><b>hpcdup</b> the color duplex (double-sided) queue
            </ul> 
             Please see the system administrator if you require assistance in setting up printing
             to these systems from your own computer.            

        <h2><a NAME=software>Available Software:</a></h2> There are a number of useful
