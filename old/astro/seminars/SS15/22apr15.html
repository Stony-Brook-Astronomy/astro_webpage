    <p>

 The bulk of a neutron star's rotational energy is believed to power
 an ultra-relativistic outflow, called a pulsar wind, which creates a
 pulsar wind nebula (PWN) when it expands into its surrounding.  When
 the neutron star is young, it is located within the supernova remnant
 (SNR) created by the progenitor explosion.  In this case, the
 evolution of the PWN is sensitive to that of the evolution of both
 the neutron star and supernova ejecta.  Additionally, the association
 of many Galactic gamma-ray sources with young pulsars strongly
 suggests that particles are accelerated to extremely high energy in
 these sources.  In this talk, I will demonstrate how the properties
 of a PWN inside a SNR can be used to measure the properties of the
 central neutron stars, its pulsar wind, and progenitor supernova --
 providing important information regarding the formation of neutron
 stars and high-energy cosmic ray electrons.
