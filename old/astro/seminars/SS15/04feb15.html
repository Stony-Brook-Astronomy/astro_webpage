Stellar Forensics with Explosions: Supernovae, Gamma-Ray Bursts, and their Environments

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <p>

Nature's two magnificent explosions, long-duration gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) and stripped-envelope supernovae (SN), are both products of
collapsing massive stars. Yet, over the last 15 years, we have not
determined the detailed make-up of the stellar progenitors of each
kind of explosion, nor the exact conditions lead to each kind of
explosion in massive stripped stars. While long-duration gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) emit relativistic jets of high-energy radiation,
stripped SN are core-collapse explosions whose massive progenitors
have been stripped of their hydrogen and helium envelopes.

I will present a number of comprehensive observational studies that
probe the progenitor environments, their metallicities and the
explosion parameters of SN with and without GRBs, as well as those of
normal Stripped SN, with the goal of constraining their progenitor
systems. I will conclude with an outlook on how the most promising
venues of research - using the many existing and upcoming innovative
surveys such as Palomar Transient Factory and LSST - have shed new
light, and will continue to do so, on the diverse deaths of massive
stars.
