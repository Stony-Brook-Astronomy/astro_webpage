The physical origin of the temporally extended (~10^2 sec) high-energy
emission (0.1-100 GeV) detected from Gamma-Ray Bursts by the Fermi/LAT
instrument has not yet been completely understood. I present the
evidences in favour of the external shock scenario, where the LAT
emission is interpreted as radiation from electrons accelerated at the
relativistic shock developed in interactions with the external
medium. I show that the modelling of LAT lightcurves not only reveals
specific features consistent with the proposed interpretation, but
also has predictive power on parameters entering the shock physics and
the physics of the prompt emission mechanism. Extension of this study
to include X-ray and optical afterglow data reveals that broadband
modelling within the external shock scenario is always successful for
the sample of GRBs with LAT temporally extended emission (10 events),
and leads to two possibilities: either the X-ray emitting electrons
(unlike the GeV emitting electrons) are in slow cooling regime or ii)
the X-ray flux is strongly suppressed by Compton cooling, whereas, due
to Klein-Nishina, the suppression is negligible at GeV energies. In
both cases the LAT flux is a more robust proxy for the blastwave
energy than the X-ray flux. On average, both cases require weak
magnetic fields and relatively large blastwave energies. These large
energies left in the blastwave reduce the efficiency requirements on
the still uncertain mechanism responsible for prompt
emission. Finally, I present preliminary results on the consistency of
the external shock interpretation with the detection rate of
high-energy emission from GRBs.
