    <p>

I'll give a pedagogical review of inflation and explain how its
physics can be constrained by searching for "primordial
non-Gaussianity", i.e. differences between the statistics of the
initial curvature field in our universe and the statistics of an ideal
Gaussian field.  Then I'll talk about observational CMB constraints,
including some new results from WMAP and Planck.  Finally I'll discuss
future prospects for improving Planck constraints with large-scale
surveys such as Euclid and LSST.
