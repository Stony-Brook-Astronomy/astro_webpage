Weak gravitational lensing is one of the most promising techniques to
probe dark energy with improved precision in the future. Our work to
date suggests that the information in the nonlinear regime exceeds
that in the two-point functions. I will discuss cosmological
constraints from non-Gaussian statistics, using the publicly available
CFHTLenS data, combined with a large suite of ray-tracing
simulations. I will also introduce the utility of cross-correlating
weak galaxy lensing with CMB lensing, a technique that will be useful
as larger weak lensing surveys such as DES and LSST come online.
