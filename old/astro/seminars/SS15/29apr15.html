A Particle Physicist's Nightmare: What If Dark Matter is Truly Dark?

Despite being ubiquitous throughout the Universe, the fundamental
physics governing dark matter remains a mystery. Current dark matter
searches implicitly assume that dark matter couples at some level to
ordinary baryonic matter via Standard Model interactions. However, it
remains possible that dark matter interacts so weakly with ordinary
matter that it will escape detection with current and near-future
technology. This particle physicist's nightmare forces us to consider
other possible probes of dark matter physics. For instance, the
evolution of cosmological density fluctuations on small causal length
scales in the early epochs of the Universe is a very sensitive probe
of the fundamental physics of dark matter.  Studying the astrophysical
structures that resulted from the gravitational collapse of
fluctuations on these small scales can thus yield important clues
about physical processes that took place in the dark sector in the
early Universe. Today, most of these structures are locked-in deep
inside the potential wells of massive galaxies, making the study of
their properties difficult. Fortunately, due to fortuitous alignments
between high-redshift bright sources and us, some of these galaxies
act as spectacular strong gravitational lenses, allowing us to probe
their inner structures. In this talk, we present a new statistical
analysis formalism to extract information about mass substructures
inside lens galaxies and discuss what this can tell us about dark
matter physics.
