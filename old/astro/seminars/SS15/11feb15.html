Studying galaxy formation in the young universe is one of the
frontiers of observational cosmology. Blank field surveys have
detected galaxy candidates at high redshift, but only with large
investments of telescope time. Gravitational lensing by galaxy
clusters can magnify distant sources and make them easier to detect,
but it also reduces the area surveyed. Our team has predicted that the
beams with the largest etendue (area in which sources are magnified)
are likely to contain multiple cluster-scale halos. We have used
projected concentrations of Luminous Red Galaxies to identify
promising beams, and begun follow-up spectroscopy to characterize them
in detail. The first two beams we have examined each contain at least
two group- or cluster-scale halos, and mass models based on dynamical
data suggest that they are at least as powerful as the HST Frontier
Fields. In one beam we found a multiply-imaged V-band dropout source
with a photometric redshift z=5.03. We are now building lens models
that combine pixel-based source reconstruction with a full
three-dimensional treatment of the lens equation. These high-etendue
beams have the potential to become legacy-class lensing fields that
will be used into the era of JWST and 30m-class telescopes to boost
faint sources into detectability.
