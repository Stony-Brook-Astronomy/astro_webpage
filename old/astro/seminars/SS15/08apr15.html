    <p>

 I will discuss some of the observational capabilities that the Thirty
 Meter Telescope will provide and some of the areas of study that will
 benefit from the TMT's capabilities. I'll describe how the telescope
 design was developed to support a broad range of observing
 capabilities and how the observatory is being engineered. Finally
 I'll describe the avenues through which astronomers can actively
 participate in the project; in the planning for a potential TMT/NSF
 partnership, preparing for the development of 2nd generation
 instruments and directing the scientific aims for the observatory.
