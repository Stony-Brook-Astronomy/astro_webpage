    <p>

Coalescing stellar mass compact objects (binary neutron stars and
black holes) are promising sources for the direct detection of
gravitational waves by Advanced LIGO and Virgo in the next few
years. Maximizing the scientific return from such a discovery will
require identifying a coincident electromagnetic counterpart.  One
possible counterpart is a short gamma ray burst, powered by the
accretion of a centrifugally supported torus onto the central black
hole.  Neutron star mergers are also accompanied by a thermal
optical/IR transient, powered by the radioactive decay of neutron-rich
elements synthesized in the merger ejecta (a `kilonova').  In addition
to providing a beacon to the gravitational wave chirp, kilonovae
provide a direct probe of an astrophysical site for the r-process.  I
will describe recent work showing how the delay until black hole
formation following the merger may be imprinted in the light curves
and colors of kilo novae.  I will also describe how free neutrons in
the outermost layers of the ejecta power a bright 'precursor' to the
main kilonova emission, which could greatly enhance the prospects for
its detection.
