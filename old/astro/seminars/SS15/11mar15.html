Electromagnetic Emission from Compact Supermassive Black Hole Binaries

    <p>
I will discuss possible characteristics of electromagnetic (EM)
emission from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries.  In particular,
any detectable EM emission is likely to be time-variable, and contain
unique spectral signatures, which should aid in identifying SMHB
binaries. I will discuss recent hydrodynamical simulations, which
suggest that the BHs accrete rapidly from a circumbinary
disk, even in the late, gravitationally-driven stages of the
merger. The accretion occurs through circumprimary and
circumsecondary "mini-disks", with quasiperiodic modulations that
depends on the binary mass ratio.  Transient "after-glows" may also be
produced by post-merger gas accretion and by merger-induced shocks in
a circumbinary disk. These time-variable EM signatures may be used to
identify unique counterparts of gravitational wave sources expected to
be detected by Pulsar Timing Arrays and by eLISA, or to discover
binary SMBHs in time-domain EM surveys.  As an example of the latter,
the quasar PG1302 was recently discovered to have a 5-yr periodic
optical variability.  I will comment on the interpretation of this
quasar as a SMBH binary candidate and its implications.
