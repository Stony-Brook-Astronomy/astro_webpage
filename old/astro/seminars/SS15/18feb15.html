Uncertainty quantification with hard problems

Accounting for uncertainty in model predictions can be the difference
between prudent analysis and wishful thinking.  Although traditional
methods of error and uncertainty analysis are useful, they typically
require untenable or unjustified assumptions in many real-world
applications that involve both epistemic and aleatory uncertainties.
Methods are needed that can relax these assumptions and thereby avoid
confounding the different kinds of uncertainty.  Such methods reflect
what is actually known, and what is not known, about the underlying
system.  Uncertainty quantification can be difficult for problems that
involve both kinds of uncertainty in strongly nonlinear models with
many repeated uncertain variables.  However, a wide array of
strategies can be employed that, in combination, can provide
computationally feasible solutions for many practical problems.
