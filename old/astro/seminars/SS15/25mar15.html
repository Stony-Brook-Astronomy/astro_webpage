Understanding the physical properties of galaxies and their evolution
through cosmic time means learning more about the Hubble expansion,
gravity, and the physical mechanisms that regulate the growth of
structures. My work focuses on developing and using better tools to
extract maximal information from ongoing and future data from large
galaxy surveys, such as CANDELS and LSST. I will present my efforts at
improving our ability to determine galaxy properties through Spectral
Energy Distribution (SED) fitting, the process of comparing
theoretical templates to observations in order to find which models
best resemble the data. I will introduce GalMC and SpeedyMC, the
Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms for SED fitting I created, and
show how they can be used to recover the age, mass, dust content,
metallicity and star formation history of galaxies, as well as to
jointly determine photometric redshifts and SED fitting
parameters. Finally, I will describe the Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark
Energy eXperiment (HETDEX), which will discover several hundred
thousand Lyman Alpha Emitting galaxies at 2 < z < 3.5 and use them to
shed light on the behavior of dark energy and gravity in this largely
unexplored redshift range, and summarize our recent efforts in
optimizing the sample selection using Bayesian statistics and machine
learning techniques.
