One Second After the Big Bang

A new experiment called PTOLEMY (Princeton Tritium Observatory for
Light, Early-Universe, Massive-Neutrino Yield) is under development at
the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory with the goal of challenging
one of the most fundamental predictions of the Big Bang â€“ the
present-day existence of relic neutrinos produced less than one second
after the Big Bang.  Using a gigantic graphene surface to hold 100
grams of a single-atomic layer of tritium, low noise antennas that
sense the radio waves of individual electrons undergoing cyclotron
motion, and a massive array of cryogenic sensors that sit at the
transition between normal and superconducting states, the PTOLEMY
project has the potential to challenge one of the most fundamental
predictions of the Big Bang, to potentially uncover new interactions
and properties of the neutrinos, and to search for the existence of a
species of light dark matter known as sterile neutrinos.
