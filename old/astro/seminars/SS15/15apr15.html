Formation of supermassive black hole seeds in the early Universe

    <p>

Observations of bright quasars at z>6-7 present a big question about
the origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with >10^9 Msun at the
central nuclei. Supermassive stars (SMSs) with >10^5 Msun formed in
the first protogalaxies are expected to collapse into seeds of SMBHs
in the high-z Universe. Such SMSs could form in the early (z > 10)
Universe if pre-galactic gas cloud has low concentrations of molecular
hydrogen (H2), which is dissociated by strong far-ultraviolet
radiation and/or collisions with atomic hydrogen. The gas cloud where
H2 is dissociated undergoes runaway collapse without a major episode
of fragmentation and forms a hydro-static protostar with ~1 Msun. The
tiny protostar grows up to be a SMS with >10^5 Msun via rapid gas
accretion at the rate of ~1Msun/yr and finally collapses to a seed BH
via general relativistic instability. I will describe a series of
physical processes of SMS formation in the early Universe. In
addition, I will talk about our recent works about necessary
conditions of SMS formation and estimate of its probability.
