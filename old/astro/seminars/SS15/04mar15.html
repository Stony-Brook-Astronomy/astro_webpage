Magnetars are the strongest magnets we know of, and show
themselves via powerful X/gamma-ray steady and flaring emission. The
energetics of such flares in our Galaxy second only the supernova
explosions. In this talk I will first review the observational
characteristics of these highly magnetic pulsars, and some recent
discoveries in the field. Subsequently, I will present what we
currently know about their life-cycle, through detailed simulations of
neutron star magneto-thermal evolution and pulsar population
synthesis. I will then finish with some considerations on how the
study of the Galactic population of magnetars might constrain their
possible connection with Gamma Ray Bursts.
