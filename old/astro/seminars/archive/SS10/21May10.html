Title : "Origin and Formation of Large Multiple Asteroid Systems"<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>Since the discovery of Ida?s companion Dactyl in 1993, the number
of known multiple asteroids has been continuously increasing and ~192
satellites of small solar system bodies are now known. Since 2003,
Dr. Marchis and his colleagues have been conducting a survey of large
asteroids (D>40 km) to search for satellites using various ground-based
telescopes and techniques, such as high angular resolution imaging
and lightcurve photometry. We are also conducting a study program
using additional techniques such as VIS/NIR spectroscopy, and mid-IR
spectroscopy with the Spitzer telescope to determine the sizes and
shapes of their components and bring constrain on their formation and
bulk densities. Dr. Marchis ' talk will cover the latest insights into
these multiple systems which are key to understanding how they formed
and evolved.
