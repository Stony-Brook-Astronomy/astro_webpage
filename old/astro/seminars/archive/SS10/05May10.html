Title : "Outer Disk Gas and Star Formation in the Local Universe"<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>Studies of galaxy evolution are still working to explain the galaxy
population that we observe at z=0.  One aspect of this local population
that is not yet fully understood is the existence of star forming regions
in outer galactic disks. The existence of extended disk star formation
has been known for many years, but one of the major discoveries made with
the GALEX satellite has been the frequency with which it occurs. Even
more recently, GALEX has revealed extended regions of star formation
around some early-type galaxies, systems long believed to be at their
evolutionary endpoint. Determining whether these red galaxies are being
rejuvenated and turning blue has important implications for galaxy
evolution, and determining the mode of star formation in these largely
sub-Kennicutt regions -- and whether the IMF of the stars formed is
universal -- has important implications for what we know about how stars
form. I will discuss some recent results in this exciting field.
