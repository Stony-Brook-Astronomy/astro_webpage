Title : "Gravitational wave astronomy and BH-NS mergers: 
Astrophysical mystery to multitool"<br>
Speaker : Richard O'Shaughnessy (PSU)

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>By the midpoint of the decade (2015), second-generation 
gravitational-wave
detectors will regularly uncover the signature of at least several tens
of few stellar mass compact object mergers each year.  Many of these
mergers will involve the disruption and capture of neutron stars into
O(few) stellar mass black holes. In this talk I review how direct
gravitational wave observations of these merger events, often combined
with coincident electromagnetic signals, can constrain a wide variety
of astrophysical processes: the life, death, and interactions of
massive stars, particularly at low metallicity;  the formation of stars
and clusters to moderate redshift; the properties of nuclear matter;
the nature of gravity in the strong field; and even the potential for
weak gravitational parity violation.
