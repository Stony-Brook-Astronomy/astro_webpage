Title : "Turbulent Combustion: Legends, Myths, and the 
Type Ia Supernova Problem"<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>
Turbulent thermonuclear flame formed in the interior of an exploding
white dwarf is at the core of current models aimed at explaining the
majority of normal Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia). This flame persists for
most of the active explosion phase and its dynamics and properties are
the primary factors that control the explosion outcome, namely the
resulting SN Ia ejecta structure and observational signatures. Yet
despite the substantial progress in recent years associated mostly
with the advent of numerical simulations, the nature of such flames
still presents more questions than answers. In this talk, the key
outstanding problems of turbulent combustion will be discussed with
the focus on their implications for SN Ia. In particular, I will
contrast our current understanding of astrophysical flames with the
modern theory of turbulent chemical flames in terrestrial systems. I
will discuss how the remarkable body of experimental and theoretical
results for terrestrial flames can be an invaluable source of insight
for the astrophysical combustion research, and, on the other hand, how
SN Ia have been responsible for rekindling interest in two of the most
intriguing and controversial questions of classical combustion.
