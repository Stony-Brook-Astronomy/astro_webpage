Title : "Cosmology with the Lyman-alpha forest"<br>
Speaker : Anze Slosar, Brookhaven National Laboratory
    </center></b></font>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>Lyman-alpha forest is the forest of absorption features in the quasar
     spectra blue-ward of quasar's Lyman-alpha emission. These are caused
     by neutral hydrogen along the line of sight to the quasar. Since
     neutral hydrogen traces baryons, which in turn trace the distribution
     of the dark matter, it is possible to use Lyman-alpha forest as a
     cosmological tool. Its main advantage is that it is a unique probe of
     high-redshift universe (z=2-3) and that quasar lines of sight, in
     contrast with galaxies, probe random and hence typical parts of the
     universe, where fluctuations are mildly non-linear and where
     complicated gas dynamics does not come into play. On the other hand,
     Lyman-alpha forest observations come with a barrage of their own
     systematics issues, some of which I will discuss in the talk. BOSS
     experiment is expected to measure spectra of about 160,000 quasars and
     I will discuss various pieces of fundamental physics that can be
     probed with it: dark-energy through baryonic acoustic oscillations,
     neutrino masses and primordial non-Gaussianities.
