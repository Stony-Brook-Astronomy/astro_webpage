Title : "First Results from FIREBall: The First UV Integral Field Spectrograph"<br>
Speaker : Sarah Tuttle, Columbia
    </center></b></font>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>FIREBall (Faint Intergalactic Redshifted Emission Balloon) is a
balloon-borne UV fiber-fed spectrograph to make the first measurements
of the WHIM in emission.  FIREBall flew successfully in June, 2009. We
combine a 1m telescope with the first fiber-fed UV integral field
spectrograph, targeting Ly, OVI, and CIV.  These measures of warm
(105-6 K) and diffuse (~1000, log NH ~ -3) gas trace the interface
between galaxies and the filamentary structure of the universe as
shaped by dark matter and gravitational collapse.  Recent simulations
(Bertone et al, 2010) demonstrate the need to understand this regime
within the context of galaxy formation and evolution.

<p>
I will discuss the project and instrument design, as well as our
successful science fight from Fort Sumner, NM.  First results from a
blind search for emission will also be presented.
