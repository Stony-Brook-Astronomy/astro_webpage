    <p>
We discuss why it is thought that there are copious amounts of dark matter
and dark energy in the universe and why this is problem for the standard
gravitational theory. We identify the freedom still present in classical
gravitational theory that might enable us to dispense with dark matter and
dark energy altogether. In particular we explore the alternate conformal
gravity theory originally introduced by Weyl. We show that it provides
fitting to a wide variety of galactic rotation curves without the need for
dark matter, and provides fitting to the accelerating universe data
without dark energy. We discuss the challenges that the conformal theory
still faces. In a related YITP Seminar talk, "Quantum aspects of the Dark
Matter and Dark Energy Problems", to be given on Thursday April 22 at
2:30pm in Math Tower 6-125, we will discuss how quantizing conformal
gravity enables us to both construct a consistent quantum gravity theory
and solve the cosmological constant problem.
