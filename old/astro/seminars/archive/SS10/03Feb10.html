Title : "Inferring the Physical Properties of Brown Dwarfs from 
	Near-Infrared Spectra"<br>
Speaker : Emily Rice, American Museum of Natural History
    </center></b></font>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>Accurate measurements of the fundamental physical
      properties of very-low-mass stars and brown dwarfs are
      crucial for understanding cool, complex atmospheres and
      calibrating evolutionary models. We developed methods for
      evaluating the physical properties of very-low-mass objects as
      inferred from high-resolution near-infrared spectra. We carried
      out detailed comparison of observed and synthetic spectra for
      a sample of young and/or field M, L, and T dwarfs.
