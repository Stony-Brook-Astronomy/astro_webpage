    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>Verification and Validation (V&V) for a numerical simulation asserts
      two properties. The first (Verification) is that the equations as posed
      are solved correctly, with controlled numerical errors. The second
      (Validation) asserts that the equations as solved are an actual description 
      of the physics problem to be solved.

    <p>We point out fundamental obstacles to V&V for standard astrophysical
     codes, and we trace the problems to fundamental issues of a mathematical
     nature. Then we show how these obstacles can be overcome, leading to a
     fluid simulation code which has been verified and validated on 
     analogues of astrophysical problems. Finally we show how the
     specialized numerical routines which have made this advance possible can
     be combined with any standard astrophysical fluid code, and how a usefule
     fraction of them can be readily inserted directly into any standard
     astrophysical fluid code.
    
    <p>The test problems for this V&V exercise are analogues of, or details
     from full fledged astrophysical situations. We study specifically the
     classical Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) (steady acceleration) and Richtmyer-Meshkov (RM)
     (shock acceleration) instabilities of a perturbed fluid interface.

    <p>A number of startling conclusions are observed. For a flow accelerated
     by multiple shock waves, we observe an interface between the two fluids
     proportional to Delta x^-1, that is occupying a constant fraction of the 
     available mesh degrees of freedom. This result suggests 
     <ol>
     <li> nonconvergence for the unregularized mathematical problem or  </li>
     <li> nonuniqueness of the limit if it exists, or </li>
     <li> limiting solutions only in the very weak form of a 
     space time dependent probability distribution.  </li>
     </ol> 

    <p>The cure for this pathology is a regularized solution, in other words
     inclusion of all physical regularizing effects, such as viscosity and
     physical mass diffusion. 

    <p>In other words, the amount and type of regularization of an
     unstable flow is of central importance. Too much regularization, with a 
     numerical origin, is bad, and too little, with respect to the physics,
     is also bad. For systems of equations, the balance of regularization
     between the distinct equations in the system is of central importance.

    <p>At the level of numerical modeling, the implication from this insight
     is to compute solutions of the Navier-Stokes, not the Euler equations.
     Resolution requirements for realistic problems make this solution 
     impractical in most cases. Thus subgrid transport processes must be modeled,
     and for this we use dynamic models of the turbulence modeling community. 
     In the process we combine and extend ideas of the capturing community 
     (sharp interfaces or numerically steep gradients) with conventional
     turbulence models, usually applied to problems relatively smooth at
     a grid level.

    <p>This strategy is verified (convergence under mesh refinement)
     for a Richtmyer-Meshkov unstable turbulent mixing problem and it is validated
     (comparison to laboratory experiments) through the study of Rayleigh-Taylor
     unstable flows. These steps solve problems of some five decades standing
     in the area of turbulent mixing. 

    <p>The essential role of a number of collaboratiors is gratefully
     acknowledged.
