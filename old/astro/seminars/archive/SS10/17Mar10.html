Title : "Mid-Infrared Silicate Variability in Actively Accreting 
T Tauri Stars"<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>During the cold mission of the Spitzer Space Telescope,
hundreds of high sensitivity mid-infrared spectra of T Tauri stars
were collected with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS).  Many of these
spectra detected emission from super-heated silicate dust grains most
likely located in the upper atmospheres of the inner regions of the
proto-planetary disks surrounding these young Sun-like stars. 
Performing detailed studies of the 10 um silicate feature, several
groups have found source-to-source variations in the morphology and
structure of the silicate emission complex.  These variations are
likely to be caused by differences in the composition and structure
of their respective dust grain populations.  Since observations of
dust grains in the interstellar medium and solar system objects
demonstrate that dust grain populations evolve from disorganized,
amorphous grains to annealed, organized crystalline structures,
previous observers concluded that the source-to-source variations of
the amorphous and crystalline mass fractions hint at a possible disk
evolutionary sequence (i.e., larger amorphous mass fraction equals a
less evolved disk).  In order to test this evolutionary sequence
hypothesis, we conducted a variability study of 11 actively accreting
T Tauri stars possessing optically thick disks to determine if the
source-to-source variations are not due to intrinsic, short timescale
variability of the silicate emission features.  For two of our
sources, we find significant variability in the strength of the
feature on month-long timescales.  For the others, we see only small
fluctuations in the crystalline and amorphous mass fractions.  I will
review the results of our observational program, offer some physical
explanations for the observed phenomena, and compare the results of
our program to those from a similar multi-epoch IRS programs.
