Title : " Extreme Stellar Explosions - The Dynamics and Observational
Signatures of Gamma-Ray Bursts"

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p> It is now clear that a subset of massive stars are capable
      of exploding relativistically. These explosions are observed as
      gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with accompanying supernovae. Stellar
      evolution thus follows an unexpected channel which I will argue is
      related to black hole or, possibly, magnetar formation. I will discuss
      progress in understanding the dynamics and observational signatures of
      these explosions. I will present new multi-dimensional simulations and
      computed light curves of GRB blastwaves in the afterglow phase. I will
      also present recent work demonstrating the generation and
      amplification of magnetic fields in astrophysical outflows relevant
      for models of GRB prompt and afterglow emission.
