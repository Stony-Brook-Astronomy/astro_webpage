Title : "The Dynamics of Exoplanets from Direct Images to Transits"<br>
Speaker : Daniel Fabrycky, Harvard 
    </center></b></font>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p> Over the past few years the radial velocity method of extrasolar
     planet detection has been supplemented by other methods.  Direct
     images (for planets far from their stars) and transits (for planets
     close in) are giving us more intimate knowledge of the physical
     properties of these planets and are providing more ammunition for
     dynamical studies.  The newly imaged multi-planet system HR 8799 is
     required by dynamical stability arguments to have either resonant
     orbits or very low planetary masses.  In another system, torque from a
     distant ("directly imaged") binary star companion could explain the
     extreme eccentricity (0.93) of transiting planet HD 80606b; that
     theory predicted the spin of the host star would be misaligned from
     the planetary orbit, which was later confirmed spectroscopically.
     Such measurements among transiting planets suggest several migration
     mechanisms account for hot Jupiters.  Finally, transit timing
     measurements are ruling out resonant companions to hot Jupiters down
     to absurdly low masses and thus may be poised to discover numerous
     resonant planetary systems using Kepler photometry.
