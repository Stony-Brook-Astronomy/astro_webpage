Title : "Stellar Multiplicity and Planet Formation"<br>

    <p>I will describe several recently-completed observational programs 
to study young stars with a range of high-resolution imaging techniques, 
including
laser guide star adaptive optics imaging and nonredundant aperture-mask
interferometry. My results indicate that many of our previous ideas about
multiplicity and planet formation were incorrect or incomplete. The primordial
binary star population for solar-type stars appears significantly different
from the field population, and the mass dependence of binary properties is
even more pronounced than had been previously appreciated. I am also placing
significant constraints on the frequency and properties of giant planets in
outer solar systems (a=5-40 AU). This indicates either that the population
parameters (frequency and separation/mass functions) suggested by RV surveys
are wrong, or that the expected fluxes are indeed fainter than older models
predicted. Finally, I have found that close stellar companions can
significantly influence the evolution and lifetime of protoplanetary disks.
Some of the "transitional disks" (disks with gaps or inner holes) that have
been suggested as sites of ongoing planet formation are instead being cleared
by close binary companions, and most of the youngest (<2 Myr) stars without
disks appear to be close binary systems where this clearing process has
already finished.
