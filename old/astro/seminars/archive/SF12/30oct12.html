    <p>
I present high spatial resolution observations of giant molecular clouds
(GMCs) in the eastern part of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946 obtained
with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy
(CARMA). For NGC 6946, we have observed CO(1.0), CO(2.1) and 13CO(1.0),
achieving spatial resolutions of 5.4"x 5.0", 2.5" x 2.0", and 5.6" x 5.4",
respectively, over a region of 6 x 6 kpc. This region extends from 1.5 kpc
to 8 kpc galactocentric radius, thus avoiding the intense star formation
in the central kpc. We have recovered short-spacing u-v components by
using single dish observations from the Nobeyama 45 m and IRAM 30 m
telescopes. Using the automated CPROPS algorithm, we identified 45 CO
cloud complexes in the CO(1.0) map and 64 GMCs in the CO(2.1) maps. The
sizes, line widths, and luminosities of the GMCs are similar to values
found in other extragalactic studies. We have classified the clouds into
on-arm and inter-arm clouds based on the stellar mass density traced
by the 3.6.m map. Clouds located on-arm present in general higher star
formation rates than clouds located in inter-arm regions. Although the
star formation efficiency shows no systematic trend with galactocentric
radius, some on-arm clouds.which are more luminous and more massive
compared to inter-arm GMCs.are also forming stars more efficiently than
the rest of the identified GMCs. We find that these structures appear
to be located in two specific regions in the spiral arms. One of them
shows a strong velocity gradient, suggesting that this region of high
star formation efficiency may be the result of gas flow convergence. In
order to increase the number of clouds in our sample and the range in
their properties, we have extended the same observation strategy that
we performed in NGC 6946 to two additional nearby spiral galaxies, NGC
5457 (M101) and NGC 628. I will show the first results of our study of
the molecular gas and star formation in these two galaxies, and we will
discuss how they compare to the properties found in NGC 6946.
