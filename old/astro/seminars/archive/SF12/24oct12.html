Two missions, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX), are currently providing new observations that allow us to investigate how stars and planetary systems interact with their surrounding interstellar environment.  IBEX is providing a detailed view of the entire heliosphere and as a result, we have excellent three-dimensional models of the heliosphere, and HST, with its high resolution ultraviolet spectrographs, is obtaining absorption line measurements of gas along the line of sight toward nearby stars from both the interstellar medium and the leading nose of heliospheric analogs around these stars, or astrospheres.  Most, if not all, of these nearby stars have exoplanets, and like our solar system, these exoplanetary systems exist within an astrospheric volume of their own.  The unique properties of a star's electromagnetic radiation and particle wind can dictate a planet's thermal and chemical atmospheric structure.  Indeed, the solar wind likely eroded a warm and wet ancient Martian atmosphere.  As our capability to discover and characterize exoplanets and their atmospheres continues to improve, the habitability of these planets will become a central and potentially radical scientific research question.  At the heart of this question will be the relationship of the planet with its host star within its astrosphere, as well as an understanding of the relationship between our own solar system planets and the Sun within our heliosphere.  I will explore these connections and present new observations that search for astrospheres around nearby stars which are known to host exoplanetary systems.
