Title : Recurrent Novae as Progenitors of Type Ia Supernovae
Speaker : Brad Schaefer, LSU
    </center></b></font>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>
The identity of the progenitor systems for Type Ia
supernovae has for four decades been one of the premier problems in
astrophysics, and its importance has only been amplified in the last
decade with the requirement of knowing the progenitor for all dreams of
precision supernova cosmology.  One of the best candidates for the
progenitor are recurrent novae, RNe, close binaries where Roche lobe
overflow pours matter onto a white dwarf, with the nova eruptions coming
roughly every few decades.  However, there are some problems ("Are there
enough RNe to produce the observed rate?" and "Is the white dwarf gaining
mass?").  In this talk, I will present new and convincing answers to this
two problems.
