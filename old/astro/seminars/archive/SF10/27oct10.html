Title : What are the Peculiar Emission Line Profiles of Recurrent Novae 
                 Trying to Tell Us?<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>The novae are thermonuclear explosions on the surfaces of white 
dwarf stars, generally in close binary systems.  The recurrent novae 
are those novae which have been observed to explode
more than once in human history. Since the explosion occurs when the
accreted hydrogen layer becomes degenerate and hot, a short time interval
implies the white dwarf is near-Chandrasekhar mass. The optical
characteristics of the recurrent novae clearly differentiate them from the
more numerous classical novae, in terms of speed of decline,
spectral line profiles, and apparent composition.

I have started a project to obtain long term, high cadence photometry and
spectroscopy of southern novae using the SMARTS facilities. After a general
introduction to novae, I shall turn to the peculiar line profiles of the
recurrent novae and the look-alike He-Ne novae. I interpret the line profiles
in these systems not in terms of an expanding equatorial torus, but in terms
of an accretion disk. I shall try to show that the spectral evolution is
consistent with the rapid re-establishment of the disk after (or survival
through) the nova explosion.
