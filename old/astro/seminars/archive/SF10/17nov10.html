Title : Star Formation in Lyman Break Galaxies, Near and Far<br>
Speaker : Andrew Baker (Rutgers University)

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <p>
Large samples of star-forming galaxies at high redshift, including
"Lyman break galaxies" (LBGs) at z~3, can be selected on the basis
of their distinctive rest-frame UV colors.  Such UV-selected samples have
provided important insights about the properties
and histories of high-redshift galaxies; however, due to individual
systems' faintness at long wavelengths, we still have relatively
little information about the details of how they are turning gas
into stars.  I will discuss two strategies for improving our
understanding of star formation in LBGs and their ilk: observing
gravitationally lensed systems at high redshift, and observing
their unlensed (but very rare) close analogs at low redshift.
I will use this discussion to address the important question of whether
radio astronomers are necessary.
