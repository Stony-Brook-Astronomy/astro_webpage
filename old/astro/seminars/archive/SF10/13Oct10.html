Title : The Formation of Molecular Clouds and Massive Stars<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>In this talk I consider two questions. First, I investigate the
formation of molecular clouds from diffuse interstellar gas.  It has been
argued that the midplane pressure controls the fraction of molecular
hydrogen present, and thus the star formation rate.  Alternatively,
I and others have suggested that the gravitational instability of
the disk controls both.  I present numerical results demonstrating
that the observed correlations between midplane pressure, molecular
hydrogen fraction, and star formation rate can be explained within the
gravitational instability picture.  Second, I discuss how ionization
affects the formation of massive stars.  Although most distinctive
observables of massive stars can be traced back to their ionizing
radiation, it does not appear to have a strong effect on their actual 
formation.  Rather, I present simulations suggesting that stars only 
ionize large volumes after their accretion has already been throttled 
by gravitational fragmentation in the accretion flow. At the same time 
these models can explain many aspects of the observations of ultracompact 
H II regions.
