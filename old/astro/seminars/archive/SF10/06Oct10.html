Title : Molecular Gas, AGN Feedback and the Unusual Case of NGC 1266<br>
Speaker : Katey Alatalo 
    </center></b></font>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>NGC 1266 is an S0 galaxy that was observed in multiple wavelengths 
as part of the Atlas3d effort which remarkably hosts about 10^9 solar
masses of molecular gas and has a spectrum that exhibits extended wings
of up to +/-400 km/s.  High resolution CARMA observations have shed
further light on this galaxy and revealed that the bulk of the gas is
concentrated within 100pc of the nucleus. Combined with the presence of
an AGN and molecular gas outflowing faster than vesc, this galaxy is an
excellent candidate for AGN feedback. If so, it is the first example of
molecular feedback into the IGM from a relatively normal galaxy. How
the gas fell so deeply into the potential well, and the exact nature of
the driving mechanism behind the expulsion of the gas remain mysteries.
