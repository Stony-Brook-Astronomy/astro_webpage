Title : Debris Disks in the Era of Terrestrial Planet Formation<br>
Speaker : Christine H. Chen
    </center></b></font>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>The terrestrial planets in our Solar System are believed to have 
formed via a multi-stage process that included the conglomeration of 
sub-micron sized interstellar dust particles into kilometer-sized parent 
bodies, the growth of pluto-size planetary embryos from collisions of 
kilometer-sized parent bodies, and the accretion of the patina from giant 
collisions between planetary embryos. The Spitzer Space Telescope has 
enabled photometric surveys of mid- and far-infrared excess around
stars in nearby young associations that constrain models for the formation 
of pluto-sized objects, and spectroscopic characterization of the 
circumstellar material that suggests that giant collisions may be 
occuring in some systems. In this talk, I will outline the properties 
of young debris disks in which terrestrial planets may be forming, compare 
MIPS photometric observations of stars in the 5-20 Myr old 
Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association to the evolution predicted by 
self-stirred disk models, and discuss possible diagnostics for giant 
collisions in young Solar Systems. I will also describe outstanding 
questions about solar system evolution that can not be addressed with 
Spitzer and will require future ground- and space-based instruments.
