Title : The Formation of Molecular Clouds and Massive Stars<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>Recent results of UV, optical spectoscopy, mm and radio observations 
reveal that a significant fraction of early-type (E and S0) galaxies host
reservoirs of cool gas and recent and/or ongoing star formation. But are the
properties of star formation and cool gas the same in these bulge-dominated
galaxies as in the more commonly studied spiral, starburst and irregular
star-forming galaxies? First I will show what a handful of these
star-forming early-type galaxies look like in detail, with CO and HI maps
for the cold gas and optical spectroscopy and UV maps to detect young stars.
Many commonly used star formation indicators fail or are less reliable in E
and S0 galaxies than in the spirals and starbursts against which they were
calibrated. I report on the mismatch between several of these tracers
including the FIR, 24 micron, 8 micron PAH, radio and H-alpha. But despite
these problems, the E and S0 galaxies surprisingly lie almost entirely
within the large scatter of the Schmidt-Kennicutt law when the normal SF
conversions are used.  I also report on preliminary studies of the
properties of molecular gas in these galaxies, using the high density
tracers HCN, HCO+ and 13CO.
