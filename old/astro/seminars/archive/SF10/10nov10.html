Title : The 2010 Eruption of the Recurrent Nova U Scorpii<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>We report on the 2010 eruption of the recurrent nova U Scorpii.
    This outburst was predicted in 2005 and discovered on 28 January
    2010 as a result of a monitoring program coordinated by our group at LSU
    in conjunction with the AAVSO. The eruption lasted approximately 64 days,
    over the course of which more than 35,000 observations were made in all
    wavelengths from radio to X-ray. We present multi-wavelength light curves
    (UBVRIJHKby+UV+X-ray) of the entire eruption which show the overall speed
    of the eruption, the expected first plateau, the unexpected second
    plateau, and the return to quiescence. The onset of the optical plateau
    coincided with the turn-on of the supersoft X-ray emission and the
    reemergence of the eclipses. Our comprehensive coverage allowed us to
    discover new fine-scale phenomena as well, such as flares of up to 0.5 mag
    in amplitude during the initial fast decline which are as yet unexplained
    and late aperiodic dips (distinct from the well-known eclipses) that are
    likely caused by accretion disk geometry.
