Title: Unexpected Sources of Coronal Emission <br>
Speaker: Rodolpho Montez (RIT)

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <p>
Coronal X-ray emission is closely linked to the level of stellar magnetic activity.  For low to intermediate mass stars, activity and the associated X-ray emission peaks in youth and decreases with age to negligible levels.  Meanwhile, the material in the largely neutral atmospheres of mass-lossing evolved stars and substellar objects alike should not couple well to the magnetic fields in underlying convective regions, thus inhibiting coronal X-ray emission.  However, X-ray emission is observed from evolved stars and substellar objects.  I discuss the evidence of coronae in these unexpected sources and how they inform our understanding of stellar and substellar evolution.
