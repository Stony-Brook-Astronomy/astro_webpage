Title: Berkeley SN Ia Program (BSNIP): Dataset and Initial Analysis<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <p>
I will present spectroscopic data from the Berkeley SuperNova Ia
Program (BSNIP), its initial analysis, and the results of my attempt
to use spectral information to improve distance determinations to Type
Ia supernova (SNe Ia). The dataset consists of 1298 low-redshift (z <
0.2) optical spectra of 582 SNe Ia observed from 1989 through the end
of 2008. Many of the SNe have well-calibrated light curves with
measured distance moduli as well as spectra that have been corrected
for host-galaxy contamination. I will also describe the spectral
classification scheme employed (using the SuperNova Identification
code, SNID; Blondin & Tonry 2007) which utilizes a newly constructed
set of SNID spectral templates. The sheer size of the BSNIP dataset
and the consistency of the observation and reduction methods make this
sample unique among all other published SN Ia datasets.
I will also discuss measurements of the spectral features of about
one-third of the spectra which were obtained within 20 days of maximum
light. I will briefly describe the method of automated, robust
spectral-feature definition and measurement used which expands upon
similar previous studies. Comparisons of these measurements of SN Ia
spectral features to photometric observables will be presented with an
eye toward using spectral information to calculate more accurate
cosmological distances. Finally, I will comment on related projects
which also utilize the BSNIP dataset that are planned for the near
future.
