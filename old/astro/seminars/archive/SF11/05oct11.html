Title: Cataclysmic Variables as Supernova Ia progenitors<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <p>
Although the identification of the progenitors of Supernovae Ia
(SNeIa) remains controversial, it is generally accepted that they
originate from binary star systems in which at least one component is a
carbon-oxygen white dwarf (WD); those systems are grouped under the wide
umbrella of Cataclysmic Variables. Current theories for SNeIa progenitors
hold that, either via Roche lobe overflow of the companion or via a wind,
the WD accumulates Hydrogen- or Helium- rich material which is then burned
to Carbon and Oxygen onto the WD~Rs surface. However, the specifics of this
scenario are far from being understood or defined, allowing for a wealth
of theories fighting for attention and a dearth of observations to support
them. I discuss the latest attempts to identify and study those
controversial SNeIa progenitors. I also introduce the most promising
progenitor in hand and I present observational diagnostics that can reveal
more members of the category.
