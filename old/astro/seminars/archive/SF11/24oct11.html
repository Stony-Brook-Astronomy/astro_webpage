For my Ph. D. dissertation, I surveyed 54 young, nearby stars for orbiting
extrasolar planets, using Adaptive Optics (AO) imaging with the 6.5 meter MMT
telescope. I used longer infrared wavelengths, the L and M bands, than
most other such surveys. My survey found no planets, but did reveal a
previously unknown low-mass star orbiting the bright star GJ 3876. My final
analysis showed that shorter infrared wavelengths will usually deliver
sensitivity to lower-mass planets than the L? and M bands used in my
study. For the very nearest stars, however, this is dramatically reversed,
and the L and especially the M band should be the wavelength of choice.

In an unrelated project, I determined the rotation period of the Kuiper Belt
dwarf planet Makemake by carefully monitoring its brightness over time and
searching for periodic variations in the data. Previous attempts to do this
had been defeated by Makemake?s remarkable lack of variability: the extremely
weak periodic signal could not be identified through the noise in the
data. High quality data from clear, dark Arizona nights, combined with a few
innovations in processing, allowed me to discover that a day on Makemake,
the eleventh largest known sun-orbiting body in our solar system, lasts
7.77 +- 0.05 hours.

<p>
In the future, I hope to work with Stan Metchev studying the weather on brown
dwarfs, that is, objects too massive to be called planets yet not massive
enough to be stars. Brown dwarfs have exotic clouds in their hot
atmospheres, composed of rocky minerals and molten iron, stirred by powerful
convection cells and by the Coriolis effect that creates hurricanes on
Earth. To study these clouds, we will monitor the brightness of brown
dwarfs. Cloud-induced periodic variations will allow us to calculate brown
dwarf rotation periods just as I did with Makemake. Beyond this, we will
learn in unprecedented detail how prevalent clouds are on different brown
dwarfs, and how rapidly they change from day to day: we will study the
weather on other worlds. I have briefly investigated the best methods for
determining the true rotation period of a brown dwarf in the presence of
changing cloud patterns ? a problem I did not face with the almost
atmosphere-less ice-world Makemake.
 
<p>
Prompted by my discovery of the low-mass star orbiting GJ 3876, and the
discovery by Eric Mamajek et al of a companion to Alcor, I would like to
search for more low mass stars orbiting bright primaries, thus filling in a
gap that appears to exist in our knowledge of binary star statistics. I
intend additionally to pursue some ideas for detecting very small main-belt
asteroids ideas whose viability I have confirmed in a preliminary sense by
experiments with my personal 0.5 meter telescope.
