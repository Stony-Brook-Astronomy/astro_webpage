Title: A Zoo of Extrasolar Planet(esimal) Compositions Derived From
Externally-Polluted White Dwarfs <br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>
Study of extrasolar planetary systems has provided a wealth of surprises,
not the least of which is the realization that the photospheres of
many white dwarf stars are the graveyards for rocky bodies that once
orbited these stars.  The photospheres present a tableau on which
the elemental compositions of these erstwhile asteroids or rocky
planets are displayed. There appear both similarities and differences
between the compositions of extrasolar rocky bodies and those of more
familiar solar system objects (e.g. bulk Earth). Collisions between
large rocky objects are indicated in some of these planetary systems.
Echelle spectra obtained with the Keck telescope at Mauna Kea Observatory
are so sensitive that, for example, they reveal the uncommon element
scandium in 3 heavily-polluted white dwarfs; in the Sun, scandium is
a billion times less abundant than hydrogen.  These spectral studies
have shown that >~30% of white dwarfs are orbited by ancient planetary
systems that contain rocky objects and major planets.
