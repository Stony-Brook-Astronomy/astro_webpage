Title: New Developments in Spiral Structure Theory <br>

    <p>
    Over 150 years after their discovery, astronomers still lack a
    complete theory for the origin of the beautiful spiral patterns in disk
    galaxies.  I will review the various ideas that have been proposed and
    describe some recent observational data that appear to support a recurrent
    instability mechanism.
