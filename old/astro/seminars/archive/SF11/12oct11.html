Title: Why Don't Massive Stars Like to Blow-up?: Numerical Simulation and 
Core Collapse Supernovae <br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <p>
The explosive deaths of massive stars are observed everyday.  It is an empirical fact
that stars more massive than about eight solar masses end their short lives by blowing-up as
supernovae but, thus far, we lack a completely successful theory that can explain why.
Sophisticated numerical simulations of stellar core collapse fail to find explosions for all but
the least massive progenitor stars.  When explosions are found in simulations, they are often
under-energetic.  I will review recent work on the criteria for successful core collapse
supernovae, including the intriguing hypothesis that three-dimensional simulations are critical.
I will discuss in detail our current efforts to simulate core collapse supernovae using FLASH
and what ingredients may be missing from the theoretical supernova stew that may explain why
robust numerical explosions have been so elusive.
