    <p>
FLASH is publicly available astrophysical community code designed to solve
highly compressible multi-physics reactive flows. It supports a wide range
of physical capabilities by combining interoperable modules to simulate
problems such as novae, supernovae, X-ray bursts, galaxy clusters, weakly
compressible turbulence, and many other problems in astrophysics and other
fields.

    <p>
Numerical solvers in FLASH are finite-volume, high-order Godunov Riemann
solvers for gas dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and special relativistic
hydrodynamics. In this talk, I will focus on a new set of two unsplit
solvers in FLASH for gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics.

    <p>
The new unsplit solvers follow the basic ideas of the 2D
corner-transport-upwind (CTU) unsplit algorithm by Colella and its 3D full
CTU extension by Saltzman (aka, 12-Riemann solver for 3D). The key
difference in our unsplit algorithm is to implement transverse fluxes that
stabilize an unsplit hyperbolic system without solving separate
intermediate Riemann problems. The scheme instead uses multidimensional
characteristic tracing to account for the stabilizing transverse fluxes,
only requiring three Riemann solves in 3D rather than 12 Riemann solves in
the full CTU scheme. The proposed algorithm is also simple and efficient
to include multidimensional MHD source terms that are important to
maintain in-plane magnetic field dynamics for MHD. The new 3D unsplit
solvers provide a CFL limit close to unity in most of test problems
available in literatures.

    <p>
The new unsplit solvers can provide flexibility and extensibility to allow
users to add additional physics to the system such as fluid viscosity,
heat conduction, magnetic diffusivity, gravity, cooling, nuclear burning,
and a mechanism to support different kinds of equations of state.

    <p>
Finally I will briefly talk about new FLASH's efforts to develop
high-energy-density physics implementations to simulate long pulse laser
direct drive experiments.
