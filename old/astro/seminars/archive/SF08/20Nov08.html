      Title : Tests of Cold Dark Matter from Gravitational
		Lensing in the SDSS<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>The cold dark matter model, in the context of a hot big bang,
    makes definite predictions about the formation of structures in our
    universe, but predicts nothing about some fundamental quantities
    such as the mean mass density or the relative amount of various
    material constituents.  In CDM, bound objects have a great deal of
    regularity in their internal structure, a so-called universal mass
    profile, and the relative spatial distribution of these objects is
    determined almost entirely by their mass.  However, the actual
    number of objects of a given mass depends on free parameters such
    as the mean and variance of the mass field.  I'll show measurements
    of the gravitational lensing effect in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
    that simultaneously test predictions of the CDM and measure free
    parameters.  I'll present measurements of the mass profiles of
    galaxy clusters, as well as large-scale cross-correlations between
    these objects and the mass field, both of which are predictions of
    the model.  I'll also show measurements of the relative spatial
    distribution of light and mass around clusters over three orders of
    magnitude in scale, and use this to infer free parameters of the
    model: the mean mass-to-light ratio of the universe and the total
    mass density.</p>
