<td><b>Tests of Cold Dark Matter from Gravitational Lensing in the SDSS</b><br>
The cold dark matter model, in the context of a hot big bang, makes definite
predictions about the formation of structures in our universe, but predicts
nothing about some fundamental quantities such as the mean mass density or the
relative amount of various material constituents.  In CDM, bound objects have a
great deal of regularity in their internal structure, a so-called universal
mass profile, and the relative spatial distribution of these objects is
determined almost entirely by their mass.  However, the actual number of
objects of a given mass depends on free parameters such as the mean and
variance of the mass field.  I'll show measurements of the gravitational
lensing effect in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that simultaneously test
predictions of the CDM and measure free parameters.  I'll present measurements
of the mass profiles of galaxy clusters, as well as large-scale
cross-correlations between these objects and the mass field, both of which are
predictions of the model.  I'll also show measurements of the relative spatial
distribution of light and mass around clusters over three orders of magnitude
in scale, and use this to infer free parameters of the model: the mean
mass-to-light ratio of the universe and the total mass density.

<tr class="gray"><td><em>Dec. 3</em></td><td>David Lafreniere<br><em>Toronto</em></td><td><b>Great catches in hunt for exoplanets: the first direct images!</b><br>
 Since the historic discovery of 51 Peg b in 1995, over 300 exoplanets
 have been discovered, indirectly, through the subtle effects that
 they induce on their parent stars. These discoveries have revealed an
 unexpected diversity of ?exo-worlds? and brought forth crucial
 information to advance our understanding of how planets form and
 evolve around stars. The picture remains incomplete, however, as
 planets on orbits the size of our solar system or larger cannot be
 detected using these indirect techniques, and accurate
 characterization of planets found in this manner is very
 difficult. Direct imaging detection is currently our only means to
 complete the picture, and would offer new possibilities to
 characterize the planets in more details.  Fortunately, huge first
 steps in this direction have just been made, with the direct imaging
 detections of a distant planetary mass candidate companion to a very
 young star in Upper Scorpius, three massive planets in orbit around
 the young star HR 8799, and a planet orbiting inside the dust belt of
 the bright star Fomalhaut. In this talk I will review each of these
 discoveries and briefly discuss their potential impact on our
 understanding of planet formation.</td></tr>
