Title : How quickly do planets form?  Studying protoplanetary disk<br>
dispersal to constrain planet formation models.<br>
Speaker : Eric Jensen, Swarthmore College
    </center></b></font>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>More than 80% of Sun-like stars are surrounded at birth by
    orbiting disks of gas and dust like the one that formed the planets
    in our solar system.  Most of these stars have lost any observable
    trace of this protoplanetary material by an age of three million
    years, much shorter than the commonly-cited theoretical timescale
    of tens of millions of years for the formation of giant planets.
    Have these stars already formed planets on a much shorter
    timescale?  Or does rapid disk dispersal mean that planet formation
    is a rare event?  I will discuss my studies of disk evolution
    around young stars, and how these data may give us insight into
    planet formation mechanisms.  In particular, I will focus on DoAr
    21, a low-mass star that has already lost its disk at an age of
    less than one million years, but which is still illuminating
    circumstellar gas with intense UV radiation; and on lithium
    depletion in low-mass stars, which may help us identify young stars
    of planet-forming age that are far from known star-forming regions.
