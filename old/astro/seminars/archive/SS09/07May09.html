      Title : The complex history of massive galaxies<br>
      Speaker : Pieter van Dokkum, Yale University
    </center></b></font>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>In galaxy formation models massive galaxies, such as giant
    elliptical galaxies, are relatively recent arrivals in the galaxy
    population: these models predict that they were built up in many
    generations of mergers, continuing to the present day. Recent
    studies with large telescopes on the ground and the Hubble Space
    Telescope have provided direct information on the evolution of
    these objects with redshift.  The talk will discuss these results,
    and outline avenues for further progress.
