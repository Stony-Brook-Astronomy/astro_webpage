      Title : Extrasolar Planets: New Insights from New Data<br>
      Speaker : Adam Burrows, Princeton University

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>Approximately 300 exoplanets, mostly giant planets in the Jovian
    mass range, but also more than 40 "Neptune-mass" planets, have been
    detected orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood.  More than 15%
    of them are transiting their primaries and these have collectively
    yielded a wealth of structural and physical information which
    theorists are scrambling to interpret.  Amazingly, a number of
    these giant planets have recently been detected directly by the
    Spitzer infrared space telescope.  These constitute the first
    remote-sensing data of extrasolar worlds. I will present the
    embryonic theory of such irradiated giant planets and discuss what
    we have learned about their atmospheres and origin.  We are
    witnessing the birth of a new astronomical discipline and I will
    attempt to describe its first halting steps on the scientific
    stage.
