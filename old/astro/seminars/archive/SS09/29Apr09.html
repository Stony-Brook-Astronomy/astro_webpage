Title : The Astrochemical Evolution of Turbulent Giant Molecular Clouds<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>Contemporary galactic star formation occurs predominantly within
    gravitationally unstable, cold, dense molecular gas within
    supersonic, turbulent, magnetized giant molecular clouds
    (GMCs). Significantly, because the gas phase ion-neutral chemical
    evolution timescale and the turbulent eddy-turnover timescale are
    comparable at typical GMC conditions, molecules evolve via an
    inherently non-equilibrium chemistry which is strongly coupled to
    the dynamical evolution of the cloud. As a result, GMC molecular
    abundances are powerful diagnostics of its underlying dynamics, and
    are crucial in interpreting observations, as well as in
    constraining theoretical models of GMCs and star formation.
    However, modeling the post-shock cooling region while also fully
    simulating the global dynamics of a turbulent supersonic clump
    presents a significant challenge to any 3D simulation, even with
    the power of adaptive mesh refinement. The postshock cooling region
    behind a hydrodynamic jump or "J-shock" is of order 1 AU in
    thickness, and a magnetized continuous or "C-shock" of order 10 AU
    thickness under typical GMC clump conditions. In contrast, a
    supersonic turbulent GMC clump is of order 1 pc in size, resulting
    in a dynamic range of four to five decades in length scale between
    the largest and smallest scales required to simultaneously model
    both supersonic turbulence and molecular shock chemistry.

    <p>We are currently addressing the challenge of the GMC
    astrochemical scales problem using a novel solution methodology,
    which permits both complex three-dimensional turbulent dynamics as
    well as accurate treatment of non-equilibrium post-shock
    thermodynamics and chemistry.  Significantly, the ability to
    compare realistic astrochemical models of turbulent GMC models
    against observation promises to expand our diagnostic windows onto
    the physics of GMCs. In particular, these models will soon help to
    elucidate the role of essential aspects of the star formation
    process, including the role of both the magnetic field and
    turbulence, as well as to shed light on new mechanisms for the
    formation of complex organic molecules.
