    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">

    <p>The space-based gravitational wave detector LISA is a joint
    project of NASA and ESA, which could be launched in about 10
    years. In contrast with ground-based detectors, LISA will observe
    important sources with very high sensitivity to redshifts of 15 or
    20. Mergers of a pair of supermassive black holes are standard
    candles: from each observation, LISA will be able to determine the
    distance (cosmologically, a luminosity distance) to the system with
    accuracies of a few percent or better, completely independently of
    the various cosmological distance ladders. Simultaneous and
    follow-up optical and X-ray observations have a good chance of
    identifying the host galaxy for the event, so that over the
    lifetime of LISA can provide an independent check on cosmological
    distances, on the reliability of other standard candles, and on the
    measurements on cosmological parameters. LISA should provide a
    measurement of the dark energy equation of state parameter, and
    even has a chance of constraining its evolution in time out to
    redshift 2 or greater.
