Title : The Origin of Brown Dwarfs
Speaker : Kevin Luhman, Penn State University

The origin of brown dwarfs is a mystery because standard theories
of star formation cannot easily create objects at such low masses.
I will review the current state of observational and theoretical
work on understanding how brown dwarfs form. I will first describe the
latest measurements of various properties of brown dwarfs, including
their initial mass function, binarity, circumstellar environment
(disks, accretion, envelopes), and spatial and velocity distributions
at birth, and I will then compare these data to the predictions of
theories for the formation of brown dwarfs.
