Title : "Outflows from young stars and their effect on the star
formation process"<br>
Speaker : Hector Arce, Yale University
    </center></b></font>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>Outflows from young stars are among the most prominent
    signposts of star formation. They deposit energy and momentum into
    their surroundings and have a considerable impact on the dynamics,
    distribution, and chemical composition of the gas in star-forming
    clouds. Outflows from young stellar objects originate within a few
    AU (or less) of the forming star and may reach linear sizes of a
    few parsecs. Thus, they interact with a variety of environments in
    the interstellar medium, from the high-density envelope
    surrounding the protostar to the low-density atomic medium
    surrounding the parent molecular cloud. I will discuss how we
    assess the impact protostellar outflows have on their surroundings
    from regions close to the protostar to cloud-size (parsec) scales.
