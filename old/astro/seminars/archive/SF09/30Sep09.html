    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>"I will present the Astrophysical Institute of the
    Friedrich-Schiller-Universtity Jena. The three groups -
    Observations, Theory, Laboratory - will be presented in an
    overview.  Afterwards the most important research projects are
    presented, with focus on the Observations group, where I'm a
    member of.  The second part of the talk will concentrate on our
    observatory in Grossschwabhausen. A special issue of "Astronomical
    Notes" with 11 refereed articles based on observations carried out
    with our observatory was published recently and will be
    presented."
