Title : "THE ISM, ALMA, EVLA  & HERSCHEL"<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">

    <p>The interstellar medium (ISM) contains the gas that fuels star
       formation as well as accretion onto supermassive black holes
       (SMBHs) in galaxies.  As such the ISM is a key piece in the
       puzzle of galaxy formation and evolution: how and when did the
       first galaxies and their SMBHs form, and what physical
       processes regulate the star formation rate and black hole
       accretion?  Finding the answers to these fundamental questions
       constitute the overarching challenge for extragalactic atronomy
       in the years to come, and will require characterizing in detail
       the microscopic (e.g.  densities, temperatures, abundances) and
       macroscopic (e.g.  star formation, morphology, kinematics)
       physical properties of the ISM in galaxies across cosmic time -
       from the first proto-galaxies emerging less than one billion
       years after the Big Bang to starburst galaxies in our cosmic
       backyard. The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), the
       Extended Very Large Array (EVLA) and the recently launched
       Herschel Space Telescope are major facilities specifically
       designed to study the gas and dust content in galaxies, and in
       this talk I will outline how they, each in their own unique
       way, will have a ground-breaking impact on this endeavour.
