    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>The first unambiguous direct detections of extrasolar planets
    made the front page of The New York Times in November, 2008.
    While more than 350 exoplanets have been discovered using indirect
    techniques, the direct detection of this class of object has
    remained at the sensitivity limits of ground based
    observatories. The development of improved adaptive optics systems
    and high contrast instruments has increased the sensitivity to
    exoplanets.  I will present recent results from the OSIRIS
    infrared lenslet-based integral field spectrograph (IFS) operating
    behind the Keck II adaptive optics (AO) system.  The OSIRIS
    integral field sampling simultaneously monitors the PSF over a
    broad band (20%), and this sampling is used to identify and
    suppress speckle diffraction features.  I will also discuss
    next-generation high contrast imaging surveys at the Palomar 200"
    and the Subaru Telescope.  Finally, I will briefly review recent
    ground- and space-based exoplanet detection technology
    developments at the Princeton High Contrast Imaging Laboratory.
