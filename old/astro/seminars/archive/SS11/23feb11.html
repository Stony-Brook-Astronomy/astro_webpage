Title: Not your Parents' M Dwarfs: Probing the Milky Way with its
Smallest Constituents<br>
Speaker: Andrew West (Boston University)

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>
M and (early-type) L dwarfs are the smallest, coolest and least
massive stars in the Galaxy. Yet despite their diminutive
physical properties, low-mass stars make up ~70% of all of the
stars in the Milky Way and have main sequence lifetimes that
exceed trillions of years. Their dominance in the Galaxy make M
dwarfs excellent tracers of both the structure and evolution of
the local Milky Way. In addition, low-mass dwarfs have intense
stellar flares and strong magnetic fields that allow us to
probe their interiors and may have important consequences for
the habitability of planets that orbit them. I will present
results from the largest samples of low-mass stars ever
assembled. The advent of large surveys such as the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has yielded photometric and
spectroscopic catalogs of more than 100 million and 70,000
stars respectively. Specifically, I will highlight work that
has used the unprecedented statistical power of the SDSS to
examine the structure and kinematics of low-mass dwarfs in the
Milky Way, as well as the nature of their magnetic fields (and
subsequent activity) and what this may tell us about the ages
of stars. In addition, I will share some resent results from a
survey that cataloged some of the widest binaries in the Milky
Way and demonstrate how a large sample of M dwarfs has helped
us map the three-dimensional distribution of dust in the local
Galaxy.
