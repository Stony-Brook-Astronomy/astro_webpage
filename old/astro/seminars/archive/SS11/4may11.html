Massive stars drive the evolution of the interstellar medium and
hence play an important role in the evolution of their host galaxies,
yet their formation remains poorly understood. Recent Spitzer mid-IR
surveys reveal a large number of individually resolved massive young
stellar objects (YSOs) in the Magellanic Clouds, providing an excellent
opportunity to study massive star formation with metallicity and galactic
environment different from the Milky Way. We have used Spitzer IRAC/MIPS
and complementary near-IR and optical data to study massive YSOs in HII
complexes in the Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC and SMC) and
the high HI column density, N(HI), portion of the Magellanic Bridge;
these systems span a metallicity range of 1/3-1/8 Zo, and a range
of galactic environment from minor interacting in the LMC to tidally
disrupted in the Bridge. To compare properties of YSOs in these systems,
we have modeled their spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and found
that their masses range from 4 to 45 Mo in the LMC and SMC while the
most massive ones are only ~10 Mo in the Bridge. Furthermore, for the
same mass range, YSOs in the Bridge appear less embedded as almost all of
them are visible at optical, opposed to only a small fraction in the LMC.
The smaller extinction is likely due to the Bridge's lower dust content
in the molecular clouds or circumstellar envelopes, or both. To assess the
metallicity or environmental effect on large-scale star formation, we have
used complete samples of YSOs in the LMC and the Bridge to estimate the
probability of finding YSOs at a given N(HI). We found that the LMC has
~3 times higher probability than the Bridge for N(HI) > 10x10^20 cm^-2,
but the trend reverses at lower N(HI). Different formation mechanisms of
molecular clouds, such as colliding flows, are likely to be responsible
for the reverse trend.
