Title : Star Formation in Unexpected Places -- The Ultraviolet View of Galaxy Evolution Provided by GALEX<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <p>
  GALEX has revolutionized the study of star formation in nearby galaxies, fully realizing the potential of UV as a SFR tracer directly linked to the photospheric emission of hot stars rather than the ISM.  Much of the new UV insight has focused on low density / low surface brightness environments previously thought to be quiescent in terms of star formation.  I will review the main discoveries stemming from GALEX survey observations.   In particular, I will describe ongoing investigations pertaining to extended UV-disk (XUV-disk) galaxies, star-forming early type galaxies, low surface brightness galaxies (both large and small), tidal dwarfs, and intergalactic gaseous debris.
