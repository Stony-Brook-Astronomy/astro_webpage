    <p>

Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) are exquisite tools with which to trace the
history of cosmic expansion, and they have a starring role in attempts
to understand the dark energy that drives our accelerating
Universe. Current supernova samples have grown to a size where
systematic uncertainties are beginning to dominate statistical ones. I
will describe the factors that limit the precision of our cosmological
inferences and avenues for improvement, with a focus on understanding
the reddening of SN Ia (by dust or otherwise) and constraining SN Ia
progenitor models through observations of peculiar objects. I will
also discuss new applications of precise distances from SN Ia in
current and upcoming surveys.
