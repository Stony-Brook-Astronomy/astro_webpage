Title : Rare Views of Ordinary Star Forming Galaxies at High Redshift<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <p>
Understanding the evolution of star forming galaxies up to early cosmic times
is an important problem in astrophysics.   By undertaking galaxy redshift surveys
in the fields of massive galaxy clusters, we are identifying the brightest examples of
ordinary star forming galaxies back to when the universe was only 900 million years old.
Our sample is bright enough to acquire spectroscopy that spatially resolves individual
stellar populations along the disks.  These studies are made possible by the
combination of telescopes bound to the Earth plus large gravitational telescopes.
In concert with large statistical studies of galaxy ensemble properties, these rare
studies of individual objects are leading to a better understanding of the physics
of baryonic mass assembly and the distribution of dark matter.
