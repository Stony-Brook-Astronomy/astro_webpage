Title : Incomplete Detonations in Thin Helium Layers on Accreting White Dwarfs<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <p>
Theoretical work has shown that low mass (0.01-0.1 solar masses) helium shells will unstably ignite on the
accreting white dwarf (WD) in an AM CVn binary. For more massive (>0.8 solar masses) WDs, these helium
shells can be dense enough that the convectively burning region runs away on a timescale comparable to the
sound travel time across the shell; raising the possibility for an explosive outcome rather than a faint
helium novae. The nature of the explosion (i.e. deflagration or detonation) remains ambiguous, is
certainly density dependent, and likely breaks spherical symmetry.

<p>
We study the case of detonation, in which a laterally propagating front moves along the surface of the
star in the geometrically thin shell.  A particular concern is the potential for radial expansion to
quench the burning, potentially inhibiting the successful propagation.  Our 2-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulation results, supported by steady-state detonation calculations with larger nuclear networks, show
that the radial expansion time of <0.1 s does lead to  incomplete helium burning, but that the nuclear
energy release is still adequate to realize a stable, self-sustained laterally propagating detonation.
These detonations propagate at about 60% of the Chapman-Jouguet speed (that for complete burning to
iron-group ashes).  The ashes are typically quite helium rich, with mass fracations of order 0.5 and have
fairly little Ni-56, with the dominant heavy elements being Cr-48 and Ti-44 in more dense regions and
Ca-40 in less dense regions
