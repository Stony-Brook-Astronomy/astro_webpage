Title : Simulating and Examining the First Stars in the Universe<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <p>
The concordance model of the first stars in the Universe for the last
decade contained the central thesis that these stars were massive,
formed in isolation, and were but a brief moment in the history of the
universe.  However, recent advances in microphysical modeling and
simulation sophistication suggest that this may not be the case.  We
discuss a cosmological simulation in which the central 50 solar-mass
clump breaks up into two cores, having a mass ratio of two to one,
which will likely form a binary star system.  Additionally, we will
present ongoing work to sample a number of primordial star-forming
halos, to constrain the initial mass function of these first stars.
We discuss the formation and settling of accretion disks, mechanisms
for terminating accretion, the incidence of multiples, and potential
further mechanisms for constraining and examining fragmentation.  We
conclude with a look toward possible future work for understanding the
initial mass function of the very first stars to form in the Universe.
