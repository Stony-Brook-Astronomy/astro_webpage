    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <p>
When a neutron star accretes matter from a normal companion star, material in
its crust is slowly compressed and pushed to higher densities. Nuclear reactions
at the surface process accreted matter into iron-peak elements and these
are later transformed in more neutron rich nuclei that finally merge into the star's core.
These reactions heat up the whole stellar interior. In the Quasi Persistent Transients
(QPTs) month to year long periods accretion are followed by even longer, decades to
centuries, period of quiescence. In these systems, when accretion stops the
surface temperature of the heated neutron star can be, and has been, followed
revealing what is likely to be the thermal relaxation of the neutron star crust.
Modelling of these crust cooling events appears to be quite successful and allows
us to map with impressive details the thermal and transport properties of the neutron
star crust, putting constraints on the novel states of matter present there, as a superfluid
coexisting with a lattice and a "nuclear pasta" phase with highly deformed nuclear
clusters at the crust-core interphase.
