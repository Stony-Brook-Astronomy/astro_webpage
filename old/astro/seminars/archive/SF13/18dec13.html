The MALT90 Survey: What 2000+ Molecular Line Maps Reveal About Massive Star Formation <br>
Speaker : Jonathan Foster (Yale)

    <p>
I will present results from The Millimeter Astronomy Legacy Team at 90 GHz (MALT90) Survey, a mapping survey of more than 2000 clumps associated with all phases of high-mass star formation in the southern Galactic Plane. After describing the survey design and calibration, I will show our work towards finding the distances to MALT90 objects via both kinematic and extinction distances. I will present the results of studies examining the chemical trends in MALT90 objects and show how unusual chemistry may reveal hidden star formation. I will also present a local version of the surface-density versus star-formation-rate relation (aka the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation). MALT90 is a finding chart for interesting ALMA targets, and I will discuss our ALMA observations of "The Brick", a unique molecular cloud towards the Galactic Center with many interesting puzzles.
