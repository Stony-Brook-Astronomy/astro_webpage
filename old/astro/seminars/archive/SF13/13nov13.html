Replay: Echoes of Light from Eta Carinae <br>

    <p>
Eta Carinae  is one of the most massive star systems in the Milky Way. Visible in the southern hemisphere and known for its fitful variability, Eta Carinae underwent a tremendous eruptive event in the mid-nineteenth century - the .Great Eruption. - which brightened Eta Carinae to became the second-brightest star in the sky. This event is generally though of as the prototype supernova impostor. The Great Eruption remains, however, unique, lasting over ten years and ejecting more than ten solar masses of material in an event that released ten per cent of the energy of a typical core-collapse supernova, without destroying the star.

<p>
While it is true that "You never get a second chance to make a first impression", once in a while  cosmic events get a second chance at being observed, when light from a brightening event reflects off sheets of cosmic dust and is redirected toward earth, allowing us to re-see the eruption decades, sometimes centuries later:  a 'light echo". In 2011, we discovered light echoes from Eta.Carinae's Great Eruption, which we can now re-observe and study with modern instrumentation.  I will show how these light echoes force us to review our first impression of this dramatic stellar eruption.
