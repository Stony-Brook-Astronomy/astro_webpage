 Although they have been used as distance indicators that helped determine the accelerating expansion of the Universe (Nobel Prize in Physics 2011), the explosion mechanism of thermonuclear --- or Type Ia --- supernovae is not well understood.  There are several proposed explosion mechanisms in the literature, however, reproducing the observed nucleosynthetic yields and highly structured ejecta remains challenging.  Indeed, one dimensional hydrodynamic models of the historically favored "single degenerate" model have been able to reproduce the observed overall energies of the explosions, whereas detailed three dimensional studies have only become computationally feasible within the last decade.  Furthermore, the multidimensional studies almost always focus on a single aspect of the supernovae --- after the start of the runaway.  In this talk I will describe the work we have been performing with several large-scale, multiphysics hydro codes on the single degenerate model, starting from the early subsonic convection driven by core carbon burning, to the ignition of a localized runaway and its subsequent buoyant evolution toward the stellar surface.  I'll discuss some of the interesting physics that occurs in the different stages of evolution.  I'll also describe the role the background turbulence --- generated from centuries of convection --- plays on the evolution of a buoyant flame, and preliminary work on the resulting strong shear flow as the flame breaks through the stellar surface and spreads.
