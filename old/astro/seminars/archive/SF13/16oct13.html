Observing Coalescence of Neutron Stars and Black Holes <br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <p>
Binary neutron stars and/or stellar-mass black holes are
unique laboratories for strong-field gravity and high-energy
astrophysics. Coalescence of these extreme objects are among the most
energetic cataclysmic astrophysical events in the universe, emitting
most of their energy in the form of gravitational-wave (GW) radiation.
They are also believed to be progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts,
r-process radiation and other electromagnetic transients. Due to their
transitive nature, up until now direct observations of these systems
have been virtually impossible except via their beamed gamma-ray
emission which could not provide unequivocal identification. In my
talk I will describe ongoing efforts to employ the network of advanced
LIGO and Virgo detectors (to become operational in 2015) for detection
of GW radiation from coalescing compact binaries. GW data combined
with results of coordinated follow-up observations and independent
transient surveys across broad EM spectrum, from radio to gamma-ray,
will provide us with complete picture of the process of coalescence. I
will discuss some of the main challenges in carrying out such
observations and required data analyses. In particular, I will talk
about observations of orphan afterglows using low-frequency widefield
radio arrays such as Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). I will conclude
with discussion of prospects for routine observations of GW and EM
signals from coalescing binaries in the second half of this decade.
