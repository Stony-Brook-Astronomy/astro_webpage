Enormous Hot Blobs from Outer Space: AGN feedback caught in the act? <br>

    <p>
By combining extensive Keck spectroscopy with the all sky data from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we have discovered a new population of high-redshift galaxy that have many of the features expected of a system undergoing feedback.  Historically, finding systems in this phase has been observationally challenging due to how short-lived the feedback period is. However, our mid-IR color-selection is remarkably efficient at finding galaxies with extreme IR luminosities (Hyper-ULIRGs; L_IR>10^13-14), powerful outflows, and extended Lyman-alpha emission on spatial scales of 40-100 kpc (i.e Lyman-alpha 'blobs'). We argue that this population represents a transitional phase in the formation of massive ellipticals, and provides a new-found laboratory to study the feedback processes thought responsible for the red sequence.  I will present the multi-wavelength properties of these galaxies, discuss possible mechanisms behind the extended Lyman-alpha emission, and place them in context with other high redshift populations. Finally, I will discuss the future directions required to further our understanding of these newly discovered galaxies in the near term with ALMA, HST and Palomar as well as for future facilities like LSST and TMT.
