    <p>
As part of the ongoing CASTOFFS survey to identify and characterize young, M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood, we have recently confirmed the binary nature of the nearby, very low-mass system NLTT 33370 (M7 +/- 1) with adaptive optics (AO) imaging.  We have also obtained integrated light optical and near-infrared spectroscopy to characterize the system.  The AO imaging reveals significant orbital motion between 2013 February and 2013 April.  Optical spectra exhibit weak, gravity sensitive alkali lines and strong Li 6708 A absorption that indicate the system is younger than field age. VLT-SINFONI near-IR spectra also show weak, gravity sensitive features and spectral morphology that is consistent with other young, very low-mass dwarfs with ages ~30-200 Myrs.  We combine the constraints from all age diagnostics to estimate a system age of 100^{+50}_{-70} Myrs. The 1.2-4.7 um spectral energy distributions of the components point toward T_eff=3200 +/- 500 K and  T_eff=3100 +\- 500 K for NLTT 33370 A and B, respectively. Evolutionary models predict component masses of ~100 M_Jup from the estimated luminosities.  Preliminary orbit simulations with only 4 epochs of imaging data already provide reasonable constraints on the period, eccentricity, and total system mass.  The proximity, age, and late-spectral type of this binary make it very novel and an ideal target for rapid, complete orbit determination. The system is one of only a few model calibration benchmarks at young ages and very low-masses.
