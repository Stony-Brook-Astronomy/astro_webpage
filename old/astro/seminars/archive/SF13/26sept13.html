The Atomic to Molecular Gas Transition in Galaxies <br>
Speaker : Tony Wong (UIUC)

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <p>
Molecular hydrogen (H_2) is the direct fuel for star formation, yet in most galaxies the neutral interstellar medium is predominantly atomic (HI).  In equilibrium, the H_2-to-HI ratio is governed directly by photodissociation balance, which in turn is sensitive to the environmental conditions which determine gas density, pressure, and metal abundance.  I review several recent models for how the HI-H_2 balance is set and present recent radio observations of spiral galaxies and the Large Magellanic Cloud that can be used to test them.  I will close with some implications for galaxy evolution and ideas for future work.
