Title: X-ray Scattering in the IGM<br>
Speaker: Lia Corrales (Columbia)

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p> X-rays offer a unique and direct method to probe dust in the interstellar and intergalactic medium.  Small angle
scattering through dust grains produces a diffuse `halo' image around X-ray point sources, which has been observed
as a result of interstellar dust in the plane of the Milky Way.  I will review the exciting prospects for observing
X-ray scattering through dust in the intergalactic medium.  Dust dispersal mechanisms will preferentially destroy
small grains, leading to a population of large `grey' intergalactic dust that affects cosmological SNe surveys in
both the optical and infrared.  Quantifying the amount of dust in the IGM also offers information about the cosmic
history of star formation and galactic feedback mechanisms.  I will describe how X-ray scattering images can yield
insight towards the nature of IGM `clumps' such as DLAs and other absorption line systems.
