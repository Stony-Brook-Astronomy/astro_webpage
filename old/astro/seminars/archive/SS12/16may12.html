Giant Molecular Clouds in Nearby Spiral Galaxies<br>

    <p>
Resolved observations of molecular gas in nearby galaxies lend insight into
many of the processes involved in galaxy evolution, as studies of the
evolution of galaxies from high redshift to z=0, the evolution of spiral
galaxy structure, and star formation within giant molecular clouds are all
anchored on these observations. I will present and place in context recent
observations of CO (J=1-0), the most commonly used tracer of molecular
hydrogen, in the centers of four nearby spiral galaxies and discuss the
properties of the GMCs located in these regions.
