Title:Debris Disk Dynamics: A Key for Finding Hidden Exoplanets<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <p>
Extrasolar planets sculpt the debris disks around Beta Pictoris,
HR 8799 and probably Fomalhaut. Many other circumstellar disks likely
contain planets we could locate if we could better read their dynamical
signatures in the circumstellar dust. I'll describe some recent progress
in the development of this powerful planet-finding technique that's
just coming into fruition: new 3-D models of debris disk dynamics that
incorporate both collisions and resonant trapping of dust for the first
time.  These new techniques, coupled with high-contrast imaging on large
telescopes, will allow us to interpret planetary signatures imprinted on
a whole new range of disks. This method is probably the only way to find
true Neptune analogs and the youngest Earth analogs orbiting nearby stars.
