    <p>
The lensing of the cosmic microwave background by large-scale structure
has been robustly detected by two experimental groups during the previous
year.  I will discuss the use of this effect to measure cosmic growth and
structure, as well as to help understand properties of galaxies at high
redshift.  I will also address the prospects for further improvements
in precision, as well as data analysis challenges, with upcoming datasets.
