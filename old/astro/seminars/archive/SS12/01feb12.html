Title: Gamma-Ray Bursts as Tools for Extragalactic Astrophysics

    <p>
Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the brightest light sources in the
Universe, as well as the most distant sources known. These
characteristics, combined with their powerlaw spectra, make them ideal
cosmological probes. In this talk I will discuss how GRBs are
impacting several areas of cosmology. In particular, I will show how
they can be used to trace the evolution of the mean density and
clumpiness of the interstellar medium with redshift, and the
properties of dust in high-z galaxies. Detection of GRBs at very high
redshifts can help set constraints on the small-scale power spectrum
of density fluctuations. High-resolution observations of long GRBs
allow to shed light on the properties of their massive star
progenitors.  Statistical studies of short GRBs can improve our
understanding of evolutionary binary scenarios.
