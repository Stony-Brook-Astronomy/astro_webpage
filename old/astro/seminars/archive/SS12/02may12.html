Approximately 1% of white dwarfs somehow become type Ia supernovae
(SNIa).  But how do they gain enough material to explode?  One of the
easiest progenitor scenarios to test is that of a wide binary in which
a white dwarf accretes from a red-giant companion.  I will review the
strong evidence both for and against such wide binaries as progenitors
of SNIa, and the resulting implication that the progenitors of SNIa
could be diverse.  In addition, since mass expulsion in nova eruptions
is one of the main obstacles for an accreting white dwarf on its way
to becoming a SNIa, I will also describe recent observations of novae
that reveal so many surprises and conundrums that it is fair to say
that the amount of mass ejected from novae, and thus the degree to
which novae prevent a white dwarf from approaching the Chandrasekhar
limit and experiencing a SNIa, is still an open question.
