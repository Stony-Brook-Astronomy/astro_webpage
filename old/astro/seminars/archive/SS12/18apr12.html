Contrary to their dimness, M-dwarf stars hold significant promise for
illuminating the processes that govern the formation and evolution of
stars, planets, and the Milky Way. Calibrating the fundamental parameters
of M-dwarfs, however, is a difficult challenge from both an observational
and theoretical perspective. In particular, the determination of their
metallicities has proved to be extremely problematic. To address this
problem, we obtained K-band spectra for 133 nearby (d<33 parsecs)
M-dwarfs, including 18 M-dwarfs with FGK companions, 11 M-dwarf planet
hosts, more than 2/3 of the M-dwarfs in the Northern 8pc sample, and
several M-dwarfs from the LSPM catalog. From these spectra, we measured
equivalent widths of the Ca and Na lines, and a spectral index quantifying
the absorption due to H2O opacity. We used the strength of the Na, Ca
and H2O features of 18 M-dwarfs with reliable metallicity estimates from
FGK companions to construct an empirical [Fe/H] indicator applicable for
M dwarfs with near-solar metallicities (-0.69<[Fe/H]<+0.31,sigma=0.141
dex). For the first time, we derive an expression for an M-dwarf's overall
metallicity [M/H]; quantitative comparisons to model atmospheres, which
are benchmarked according to overall metallicity, provide a qualitative
validation of our approach, but also demonstrate an overall offset between
the atomic line strengths predicted by models as compared to actual
observations. Our metallicity estimates reproduce expected correlations
between metallicity and Galactic space motions and Hα emission line
strengths, as well as returning statistically identical metallicities
for M-dwarf companions within a shorted multiple system.  Finally, we
provide a list with promising M-dwarfs targets for planet searches in the
Solar Neighborhood based on their metallicity, Hα emission, and rotation.
