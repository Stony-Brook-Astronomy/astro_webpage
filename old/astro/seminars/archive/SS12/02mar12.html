Despite pervasive residual star formation, early-type galaxies are
generally considered "red and dead", composed exclusively of old stars
with no star formation. Here, their molecular gas content is
constrained and discussed in relation to their evolution, supporting
the continuing importance of minor mergers and/or cold gas
accretion. First, as part of the Atlas3D survey, the first complete,
large, volume-limited survey of CO in normal early-type galaxies is
presented. At least of 23% of local early-types possess a substantial
amount of molecular gas, the necessary ingredient for star formation,
independent of mass and environment. Second, using CO synthesis
imaging, the extent of the molecular gas is constrained and a variety
of morphologies is revealed. The kinematics of the molecular gas and
stars are often misaligned, implying an external gas origin in over a
third of all systems, more than half in the field, while external gas
accretion is shut down in clusters. Third, many objects appear to be
in the process of forming regular kpc-size decoupled disks, and a star
formation sequence can be sketched by piecing together
multi-wavelength information on the molecular gas, current star
formation, and young stars. Fourth, early-type galaxies do not seem to
systematically obey all our usual prejudices regarding star formation
(e.g. Kennicutt-Schmidt law, far infrared-radio continuum
correlation), suggesting a greater diversity of star formation
processes than observed in disk galaxies. Lastly, a first step toward
constraining the physical properties of the molecular gas in
early-type galaxies is taken, by modeling the line ratios of density-
and opacity-sensitive molecules in a few objects. Taken together,
these observations provide a much greater understanding of the gas
cycle in local early-type galaxies, and argue for the continuing
importance of (minor) mergers and cold gas accretion. In the future,
spatially-resolved ALMA observations of high-density molecular gas
tracers will probe the interstellar medium and star formation laws
locally, in a regime entirely different from that normally probed in
spiral galaxies.
