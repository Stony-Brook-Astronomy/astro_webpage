I will also discuss the implications of the recent detection of radio
pulsations from the magnetar in the Galactic center.  Despite
predictions of large populations of both ordinary and millisecond
pulsars in the Galactic center, none have been detected within 25 pc
by deep radio surveys. I will argue that an intrinsic deficit in the
ordinary pulsar population is the most likely reason for the lack of
detections to date: a "missing pulsar problem" in the Galactic
center. In contrast, I will show that the discovery of a single
magnetar implies efficient magnetar formation in the region.  In
addition I will present new observtions that shed light on the
formation of the galactic center magnetar and the putative kick it
received.
