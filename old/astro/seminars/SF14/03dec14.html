When I started using SMARTS to observe galactic novae nearly 12 years ago,
little did I know how challenging and engrossing this endeavor would prove.
After all, the nova problem has been solved many times, and the novae have been
thought to be almost fully understood. This could not be further from the truth.

Novae, thermonuclear runaways on the surfaces of white dwarfs, explode on
timescales of days to years, which is ideal for synoptic monitoring with the
SMARTS facilities.
After an introduction, I will discuss what we are learning about the
central engine from Swift observations of the soft X-rays and SMARTS
photometry and spectroscopy, illustrated by the He-N nova
KT Eridani (N Eri 2009).
The recurrent nova V745 Sco shares similarities with KT Eri, but evolves much
faster. I took advantage of the Chiron echelle spectrograph on the 1.5m to
obtain synoptic high resolution spectral coverage of this and other bright
novae. High resolution reveals never-before seen details which likely will
permit us to map the circumstellar environments of the long-period symbiotic
systems. Finally, V1369 Cen put on a show over Christmas 2013. Like other slow,
dust-forming novae, it had multiple optical outbursts. Each of these
corresponds to the appearance of a new spectroscopic absorption system.
Nearly-daily observations for 5 months let us trace the dynamics of the
envelope, and perhaps to view dust formation.

In the past most novae have been ignored once they faded; long-term synoptic
photometry and spectroscopy are showing that the novae are far more complex
than we had assumed, but appropriate observations can and are revealing new
truths about these "new stars"
