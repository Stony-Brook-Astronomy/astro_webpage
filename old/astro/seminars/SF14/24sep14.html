The Range of Ejected Masses in Type Ia Supernovae

    <p>
Type Ia supernovae, the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen
white dwarfs, have been used for over a decade as precision tools for
studying the expansion history of the universe.  However, the
evolutionary pathways to supernova explosion and the physics of the
explosion remain uncertain, representing a major unsolved problem in
stellar evolution and a potential source of systematic error for
next-generation cosmological surveys.  The total mass ejected in the
explosion is a powerful discriminant between different theoretical
explosion scenarios.  The bolometric light curve of a type Ia
supernova is sensitive to the ejected mass, and moreover can be
reliably modeled using simple semi-analytic techniques.  I will
present ongoing work to measure type Ia supernova ejected masses by
modeling the bolometric light curves, validating the method by
analyzing synthetic observables from contemporary explosion models
alongside real data.  Results suggest that type Ia supernovae eject a
range of masses; that this range includes a significant relative rate
of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions; and that the ejected mass is
correlated strongly with the light curve shape parameter from
cosmological light curve fitters.  The width-mass correlation enables
the distribution of ejected masses to be measured easily for large
samples of type Ia supernovae, acting as a direct probe of binary
population synthesis models and of the evolution of progenitor
populations with redshift.
