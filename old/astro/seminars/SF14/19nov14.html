An Explanation for the Activity-Rotation Relation In Low Mass Stars

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>
X-ray luminosity in low mass stars has long been recognized as a
signature of coronal magnetic activity. Understanding such activity
and its evolution as a function of rotation and field strength is of
broad interest for the connection of these features to basic stellar
evolution and structure, as a potential tracer of stellar age, and
even potential consequences for habitability. A particularly
long-standing observation that has not yet been explained is the
curious dependence of stellar X-ray luminosity on rotation: For slow
rotators, the X-ray to bolometric luminosity increases strongly with
rotation, whereas for fast rotators, this ratio is nearly independent
of rotation. Why? Since magnetic activity depends on the generation of
magnetic fields from dynamos, we must look at what has missing from
previous attempts to associate of the two. I will suggest how the
incorporation of two missing physical concepts, even in simple models,
looks promising in the effort to explain the aforementioned
observational puzzle. I hope give a flavor for the diversity,
richness, and opportunities in the overall subject, but also highlight
a few take-away physical ideas.
