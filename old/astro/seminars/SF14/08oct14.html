Neutron Star physics with Gravitational Wave astronomy: the importance of being magnetic

    <p>

The forthcoming generation of laser interferometers will be able to
reveal for the first time the expected GW signals from a wide variety
of cosmic sources, thus opening the window of gravitational wave
astronomy.  Neutron stars are among the most interesting targets of
this exciting new field. Quite generally their GW signals will allow
to probe aspects of their physics/astrophysics hardly accessible by
other means, such as the violent dynamics in the inner regions of
core-collapse supernovae, the structure and microphysics of the ultra
dense NS cores, or the very spot where NS/BHs collide liberating huge
amounts of energy, and leaving a compact remnant whose nature in
largely influenced by the NS eos.  I will illustrate general
mechanisms through which a NS magnetic field can be critical in
promoting efficient GW emission, and discuss selected examples of the
most interesting astrophysical cases where these mechanisms can be at
work. The GW signals have, in general, specific features that make
them well recognisable and can be "easily" associated with the main
physics parameters of NSs, including of course the strength (and
shape) of their interior magnetic field, and the stiffness of their
equation of state.  Conditions for the emission of these GW signals
are such that specific electromagnetic counterparts are also
expected. Hence, complementary information can be gathered from
observations of high-energy radiation, making a strong case for a
multi messenger approach to study NSs in the present and near future.
