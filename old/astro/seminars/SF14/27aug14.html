General Relativistic Simulations of Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Gravitational Waves and Short Gamma-Ray Bursts

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <p>
 In this talk I will present results of fully general relativistic
 simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers and discuss their
 connection with current and future astrophysical observations. BNSs
 are one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves (GWs)
 that we expect to detect in the next few years with advanced LIGO and
 Virgo, but they may also emit powerful electromagnetic signals and
 they are expected to be behind the engine powering short gamma-ray
 bursts (SGRBs). During the first part of the talk I will discuss the
 role of BNS merger simulations in predicting the gravitational wave
 signal emitted during the merger and its connection with the equation
 of state of NS matter. In the second part I will instead discuss in
 detail the possible connection between the central engine of SGRBs
 and the merger of magnetized neutron stars, both in the case in which
 a black hole is promptly formed after merger and in the case of the
 formation of a magnetar.
