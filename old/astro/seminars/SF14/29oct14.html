    <p>
Gamma-rays bursts and their afterglows involve the dynamics of highly
relativistic plasma as it is accelerated at the central engine and
expands over more than ten orders of magnitude in length scale. I will
discuss high resolution studies of GRB jets using a powerful new code
(JET) which employs a moving numerical mesh, thus allowing for highly
accurate Lagrangian multi-dimensional simulations of relativistic jet
dynamics. I will present the first multidimensional simulations of a
collapsar jet starting from the center of a massive star, breaking out
of the stellar surface, coasting and producing internal then external
shocks. Synchrotron light curves computed from the simulation data
naturally produce the early steep decay and extended plateau observed
in early X-ray light curves. During the deceleration phase I will
demonstrate that GRB jets are unstable to the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability. This makes the jets turbulent, thus amplifying magnetic
fields via small-scale dynamo to values sufficient to explain the
synchrotron emission. The Rayleigh-Taylor fingers can also impact the
forward shock thus corrugating it with possible implications for the
afterglow emission. I will demonstrate fits of theoretical light
curves computed from numerical simulations to the observational data.
