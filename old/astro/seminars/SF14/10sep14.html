Where do supermassive black holes come from?

    <p>

Most massive galaxies in the local Universe appear to harbor at least
one supermassive black hole (SMBH) in their nuclei. Their ubiquity,
along with their enormous power output as active galactic nuclei, has
made SMBHs focal objects of interest for extragalactic astronomy,
galaxy evolution and cosmology. Yet, we still do not know how or when
these gravitational behemoths arrived on the cosmic scene. One of the
most important clues regarding their origins is also the most
puzzling: SMBHs with billions of solar masses were already in place
when the Universe was just 800 million years old (redshift z>7). I
will discuss this astrophysical puzzle in terms of three basic pieces,
and present a selection of proposed solutions, recent insights, and
future prospects.
