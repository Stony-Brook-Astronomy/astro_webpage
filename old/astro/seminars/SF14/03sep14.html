    <p>
I will present a method for asteroid searches, called digital tracking, which greatly increases the sensitivity of any given telescope to faint unknown asteroids. My April 2013 observations using the 0.9m WIYN telescope at Kitt Peak yielded a factor of ten improvement in sensitivity to main-belt asteroids relative to conventional methods. The gain in sensitivity can be even greater for near-Earth objects, although the processing is also more computationally demanding.  Digital tracking has the potential to revolutionize searches for faint moving objects, including Kuiper Belt objects, main belt asteroids, near-earth objects, and even anthropogenic space debris. It is not original to me, but I am the first to develop and apply it to discover large numbers of new faint asteroids. I am currently analyzing four nights of DECam data that I took this spring using the 4m Blanco telescope -- a data set in which I expect ultimately to detect three thousand new main-belt asteroids, most of them fainter than any previously measured and some smaller than 100m. Precise measurements of such small asteroids will enable new science on several fronts: collisional processes in the asteroid belt; specific asteroidal collisions within the last few million years; Yarkovsky orbital drift; and the origin of near-Earth asteroids.
