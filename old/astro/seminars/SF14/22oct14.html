    <p>

In 2013, the IceCube collaboration reported 28 events of high-energy
neutrino events.  They are likely to contain extraterrestrial signals,
and it is the dawn of a new age of neutrino astrophysics.  In this
talk, I try to demystify the origin of the observed neutrino signals.
I discuss various astrophysical possibilities, and then demonstrate
the power of the multi-messenger approach to reveal the origin.
