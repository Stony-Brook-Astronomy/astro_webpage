Cooling through excitation of molecular hydrogen catalyzed the
formation of the first stars in the universe, the so-called Population
III stars.  At low densities, H2 molecules were produced primarily by
a reaction sequence initiated by H-.  As the gravitational collapse
proceeded, the density increased to the point where three-body
recombination became the dominant mechanism for molecule
production. This talk will describe recent efforts to improve the
accuracy of molecular hydrogen formation rates, which are crucial for
reliable modeling of the formation of the first stars.
