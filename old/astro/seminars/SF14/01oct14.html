X-ray binaries exhibit a rich array of variability and outburst
behavior. Most of this can be well-characterized in terms of cyclic
changes between geometrically thin and thick disks, but the origin of
these changes is poorly understood at a more fundamental level. In
this talk I will discuss physical models of outbursts in two classes
of system. For black hole X-ray binaries that display state
transitions, I will argue that cyclic accumulation of magnetic flux
near the black hole can explain the hysteresis seen in the timing of
transitions between thin and thick disk states. For Be / X-ray
binaries, simulations suggest that periodic excitation of disk
eccentricity is responsible for the pattern of large and small
accretion outbursts. In both cases, it appears that established
properties of magnetized accretion flows, when combined with known
gravitational dynamics in binary systems, have promise to explain what
is observed.
