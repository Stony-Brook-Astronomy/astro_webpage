    <p>
The collapsar model explains the connection of long GRBs with dying
massive stars. According to this model the GRB jet is formed at the
center of a massive star, following it's core collapse. The jet then
breaks out of the star and emits the gamma-ray photons far from the
star, in an optically thin region. The breakout of the jet leaves a
distinctive mark on the duration distribution of GRBs - it is flat at
durations shorter than the typical breakout time of the jet. In this
talk I will show that such a plateau exists in the duration
distribution of all major GRB satellites. I will discuss the
implications of this plateau on the composition of collapsar jets and
the inferred properties of the progenitor. I will also show how this
plateau can be used to better classify collapsar GRBs from non
collapsars.
