Our X-ray view of winds in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has
significantly improved in recent years. In this talk I will briefly
review some of the main observational results in this field. For
instance, supporting evidences for powerful ultra-fast outflows (UFOs)
have been reported through the detection of highly ionized and
blue-shifted Fe K absorption lines with velocities up to ~10-30% the
speed of light. Their characteristics suggest a direct identification
with winds ejected from the inner accretion disk surrounding the
central super-massive black hole (SMBH). Significant correlations
between the parameters of these UFOs and larger-scale ionized
absorbers have been reported, suggesting their possible unification as
a single, large-scale stratified outflow observed at different
locations along the line of sight, from the vicinity of the central
SMBH up to the outskirts of the AGN host galaxy. Their detailed
acceleration mechanism(s) are still debated, but observations and
theoretical results favor a combination of radiation pressure and/or
MHD processes. The deposition of mass and energy of these winds in the
AGN host galaxy can be substantial and, indeed, they may represent the
long sought-after agent mediating the "quasar mode" feedback in
SMBH-galaxy evolution. Finally, I will show simulations of the
improvements in these studies that will come from the unprecedented Fe
K energy resolution and sensitivity of the calorimeters onboard the
upcoming space based JAXA/NASA ASTRO-H X-ray mission (launch date at
the end of 2015) and the future ESA Athena X-ray observatory (launch
date 2028).
