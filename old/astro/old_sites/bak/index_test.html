The star is rotating at 90% of its breakup (angular) velocity, resulting in an equatorial diameter 18% larger than its polar diameter and an equator ~1850K cooler than the poles.  We show here an intensity representation of the disk, blue being bright, red faint.  The cross is the subsolar point.";

The close pair T Tau Sa-Sb, detected only in the infrared, lies less than an arc sec to the south of T Tau (N).  In order to measure the mass of this binary, Gail Schaefer, Tracy Beck, Lisa Prato, and Mike Simon have been measuring its orbital motion using AO techniques at the Gemini and Keck Observatories.  The apparent orbit in the figure is centered on T Tau Sa.  It is too soon to determine the orbital parameters definitively, possible orbits having periods of 30, 40, and 50yr are shown, but already we know that T Tau Sa is the most massive member of the triple.  The T Tau system is of great interest and not all the astrometric data in the figure is ours; some of the points are taken from the literature.<br>  <p><font color='red'>Astronomical contest:</font> Estimate the orbital period of T Tau Sa-Sb.

The estimate closest to the final value submitted before 24:00h EST on Dec. 31, 2011 will receive an acknowledgement in our definitive paper presenting the orbital parameters of the pair.";

The star itself is masked by an opaque circular spot - represented by a grey circle.  The optically thin circumstellar dust is visible because it scatters light incident upon it from the star.  Unlike other stars with dusty circumstellar matter imaged in scattered light, HD 61005 is highly unusual because of its bow-shaped morphology, as seen more clearly in the larger contour-level image.  This is, in fact, likely due to the passage of the star through a previously unknown dense patch in the local interstellar medium: a region of cold neutral medium.  As the star moves through the denser medium, it accretes some of the material that it encounters, and creates a tell-tale bow-shaped density front along its direction of motion (indicated by the red arrow)";
