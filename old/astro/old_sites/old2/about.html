<H2>SUNY Stony Brook</H2><br>

<p>Amid the rolling hills of Long Island's north shore, the <a
href="http://stonybrook.edu">State University of New York at Stony
Brook</A> campus spreads out over 1,100 acres of heavily wooded
countryside. Located at the border of suburban and rural Long Island,
equidistant from the western and eastern ends, Stony Brook students
enjoy the best of many worlds. The University is less than 60 miles
from Manhattan which is <A
HREF="http://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/directions.shtml">easily accessible
by train or car</A>. At the same time, the tranquility of Long
Island's rural areas and seashores are adjacent to the campus. Stony
Brook lies about a mile from the shores of Long Island Sound, and less
than 15 miles from the wide sandy beaches of the Atlantic on Fire
Island, Long Island's southern coast. The many miles of seashore, in
addition to the state and national parklands, offer ample
opportunities for recreation.

<p>Although the University was established in 1957, its present form
began to emerge during a period of rapid growth in the late 1960's and
early 1970's. Within the past few years, the University's size has
stabilized and comprises approximately 1,700 faculty and 17,700
students of whom 10,000 are full time undergraduates and 6,000 are
graduate students. Academic buildings, laboratories, and libraries
form the nucleus of the campus. These are surrounded by six
residential quadrangles and athletic fields and facilities. In 1980,
University Hospital was opened, a 540-bed research/teaching hospital
that is the focus of Stony Brook's medical and nursing programs.

<p>Within the past 30 years Stony Brook has formed many departments and
programs that have attained highly regarded national and international
reputations. This is especially true within the Physical Sciences,
which includes the Departments of Chemistry, GeoSciences, Mathematics,
and Physics and Astronomy. As a result, Stony Brook attracts faculty
and students of the highest caliber from across the continent and the
world.

<p>The Astronomy Program at Stony Brook was formed in 1968 as part of
the Department of Earth and Space Sciences and administratively moved
in 1998 to what is now the <A
HREF="http://physics.sunysb.edu">Department of Physics and
Astronomy</A>. Since its inception, the program has expanded into
broad areas of galactic and extragalactic astronomy, nuclear
astrophysics, stellar astrophysics, and cosmology. It offers strong
undergraduate programs leading to the baccalauareate and graduate
programs leading to the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy.

<p>Currently, the program has nine full-time astronomy faculty,
several visiting and adjunct faculty, and two to three postdoctoral
researchers. The faculty has developed a significant diversity of
interests, has earned an international reputation, and can provide
students with opportunities for study and research in many fields.

<p>Courses taken by undergraduate Astronomy majors are characterized
by their small size, rarely are enrollments over 15, and their
intimate character. Instruction and learning take place in nearly
optimal circumstances. Graduates of the program go on to the best
graduate programs or are very competitive for techical positions in
industry.
