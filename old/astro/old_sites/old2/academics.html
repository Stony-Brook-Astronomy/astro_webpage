<p>The Astronomy group is formally part of the <a
href="http://physics.sunysb.edu">Department of Physics and
Astronomy</a>.  

<p><H2>Undergraduate Program</H2><br>

<p>We offer undergraduate majors and minors in Astronomy.  Courses taken
by undergraduate Astronomy majors are characterized by their small
size, rarely are enrollments over 10, and their intimate
character. Instruction and learning take place in nearly optimal
circumstances. Graduates of the program go on to the best graduate
programs or are very competitive for techical positions in industry.

list of undergraduate courses</a> offered by the department.

<p>Each semester, we award the <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/astro/UGProgram/Feingold.html">Feingold Prize in Introductory Astronomy</a> to the best student in
each of the 3 introduction classes we offer (AST 101, 105, and 248).


<p>&nbsp;
<p><H2>Graduate Program</H2><br>

<p>The Graduate Program currently has about 10-15 M.S. and Ph.D. students
actively working in Astronomical research areas, and adds three to
five new students each year. The emphasis is on a rigorous program of
study and research in astrophysics leading to the Ph.D. degree, but we
also offer opportunities for students with educational goals
culminating at the master's level. Students follow a course of study
that is both broadly based and topical, and are encouraged to
participate in research with the faculty from the beginning of their
graduate careers. Stony Brook's Astronomy Program is distinguished by
the number of Ph.D. students who have taken positions at universities
and research laboratories around the world.

<p>The first two years of the graduate program emphasizes coursework but
also includes research or individual study courses in which the
student works closely with a faculty member, often on a potential
thesis topic. Upon completion of the courses, the student takes a
qualifying examination for the master's degree and/or for candidacy
for the Ph.D. degree. The Ph.D. candidate, together with a faculty
advisor, then develops a topic for thesis research. Students may elect
either theoretical or observational subjects, according to their own
and their advisor's interests. Average time from entrance into
graduate school to completion of the Ph.D. degree is five and a half
years.

<p>Students take courses in physics and astronomy.  In addition to the
standard sequence of astronomy course (Stars, Interstellar Medium,
Galaxies, and Cosmology), specialized courses and seminars are
offered.
