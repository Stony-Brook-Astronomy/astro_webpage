<p>The Astronomy group would like to increase interactions with our
undergraduate majors and minors.  This page lists resources (both
local and national) available to undergraduates with an interest in
astronomy.

<H2>Seminars and Journal Club</H2>

<p>Anyone with an interest in Astronomy is welcomed to attend our (semi-)weekly
<A HREF="./jclub.html">Journal Club</A> and <A HREF="./seminars.html">Seminars</A>.

<p>In Journal Club, faculty, grad students, and sometimes undergraduates
present an overview of a recent research paper to the rest of the Astronomy
group.  There are typically 1-2 presentations per week, and these are very
informal.  This is a good way to learn about the latest developments in all
fields of Astronomy.

<p>For our Seminars, we bring guest speakers from around the country to talk
to us about their research.  Typically, we pick speakers with research
interests aligned with those of the different researchers in our group.

<p>The current schedules for both Journal Club and Astronomy Seminars can
always be found from the links off the main Astronomy group webpage.


<p>&nbsp;
<H2>Colloquia</H2>

<p>Undergrads are also encouraged to attend the weekly <A
HREF="http://www.physics.sunysb.edu/Physics/colloquium.shtml">Physics
and Astronomy Departmental Colloquia</A>, every Tues. starting at
4:15pm in Harriman 137 (cookies and coffee begin at 3:45pm).  There
are typically several astronomy-related talks each semester.  (Note:
don't worry if you don't understand everything in the talk---not all
the faculty present will either!  You will certainly pick up something
new from the talk.)


<p>&nbsp;
<H2>Local Research Opportunities</H2>

<P>There are often opportunities for undergraduates to participate in
research with local faculty.  This can be done informally, or for
major-credit.  

<P>The following faculty have indicated that they are interested in
working with undergraduates currently:

<p>&nbsp;
<H2>External Research Opportunities</H2>

<P>There are a number of programs available for undergraduates interested
in doing summer research in astronomy.  Here we provide links to the 
application pages for these programs as they become available.

for Undergraduates (REU)</A></DT>
<DD>The National Science Foundation (NSF) provides various astronomy programs across the country
    with funding to provide paid summer research internships for undergraduates.  This is a great 
    opportunity to spend your summer in another part of the country performing astronomy research.
    Note that the deadlines for applications are in early 2009.

    <p>You may also want to look over the list of <A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.cfm?unitid=69">Physics REU sites</A></DD>
