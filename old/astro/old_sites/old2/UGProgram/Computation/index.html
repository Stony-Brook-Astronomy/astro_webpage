<p>Most people agree that there is a place in the undergraduate curriculum
for some computation, but there are many shades of opinion about what that
means.&nbsp; Here are two notions which are relatively non-controversial.
<p><b>(1) Physics and Astronomy students are trained to solve problems.&nbsp;
If the computer is the appropriate tool, students should be able to use
the computer to solve the problem.&nbsp; Usually this will mean writing
a code, which first involves breaking the problem down to a sequence of
computational steps.</b>
<p><b>(2) The core physics topics like mechanics, electrodynamics, statistical
mechanics, and quantum mechanics, are the foundations of physics instruction.&nbsp;
Provided numerical computation enhances one's understanding, then there
is a benefit in including some computation in coursework.</b>
<p>With these notions in mind, the instructors of some of the core undergraduate
courses have agreed to add some computation as a pedagogical experiment.&nbsp;
Students with a prior knowledge of a computing language like Fortran, C,
or C++, can use the language they prefer, but we will choose Fortran as
the default language, primarily because it is easy to learn and use.&nbsp;
We will also incorporate graphics directly into the codes using the PGPLOT
graphics package.&nbsp; This package will be available on the SUN machines
in the Math sinc site.&nbsp; Getting started requires learning a few things:
<p>1. operating system.&nbsp; If you wish to use your own computer resources,
fine.&nbsp; The default option is the SUN computers which run a version
of unix.&nbsp; You don't need much expertise with unix, but need to know
a few basics.
<p>2. How to break down the problem into computational steps.&nbsp; There
are two aspects, (a) choosing appropriate units for the computation, and
(b) using an appropriate method of numerical analysis.&nbsp; You do not
need to be expert with numerical analysis, but you do need to know how
to test your results to evaluate the accuracy of your answers.
<p>3.&nbsp; A language to write the code in, and graphics to see the result.&nbsp;
Fortran and PGPLOT are a nice way to go, but use your own language if you
wish.&nbsp; Symbol manipulating languages like MAPLE, Mathcad, and Mathematica,
are valuable tools but not appropriate for the instructional purposes at
hand.&nbsp; One of the benefits of learning to write your own code is that
it provides a basis for evaluating the results of packaged programs.
