<P>
Below are the undergraduate astronomy courses offered that have
an AST prerequisite.  In addition, various reading, research and practicum
in teaching courses are offered on an ``as required'' basis.

<p>AST 301 and AST304 alternate in Fall semesters. AST 341, 346, 443, and 347
cycle every two years.

<p>&nbsp;

<P>
<B> <A NAME="301">AST301</A> - Collisions in the Solar System:</B> A discussion of
the evidence that comet and asteroid impacts have played a significant part
in the evolution of the Earth and other planets of the solar system, as
well as an assessment of the actual and perceived hazard posed by
terrestrial impacts and discussion of what can be done about it.  The
course will follow an interdisciplinary approach.  Prerequisites include
any two of AST101, 105 or 248 and the first semester of any of the PHY
sequences that require calculus.  It may not be counted for credit toward the
astronomy major.  (Typical text: Chapman and Morrison, ``Cosmic
Catastrophes''.  Satisfies DEC-H). 

<P>
Astronomers have in recent years begun to appreciate the
significance of meteoroid, asteroid and comet impacts with planets in
shaping the evolution of the solar system.  Such impacts have probably also
played an important role in the evolution of life on the Earth.  This
course explores the role that impacts have played, assesses the hazard that
such impacts pose and considers what might be done about the hazard.
Topics include an overview of the solar system, meteoroids, asteroids and
comets, the terrestrial impact sites, extinction of the dinosaurs, evidence
of periodic mass extinctions, assessment of the risk, and risk reduction
and mitigation.


<P>
<B> <A NAME="304">AST304</A> - the Universe:</B> A discussion of the origin and
ultimate fate of the universe, designed for non-science majors with some
background in math, physics, and astronomy. Topics include the Big Bang;
formation of
galaxies; the formation, evolution, and deaths of stars; black holes and
neutron stars; how the universe ends. The level is more rigorous than
that of AST 101, but not as detailed as the AST 34x sequence.
Prerequisites are a lower division astronomy course and first semester
physics and calculus. AST304 may not be taken for major credit, but is
appropriate for the AST minor.


<p>
<B> <A NAME="341">AST341</A> - Stars and Radiation:</B> An introduction to, and
development of, a firm physical understanding of the observed properties of
stars.  Particular emphasis will be placed on describing the interaction of
radiation with matter and of the Sun as a typical star.  Prerequisites
include AST203 and PHY251.  PHY306 is recommended.
(Typical text: Bohm-Vitense, ``Introduction to Stellar
Atmospheres'', vols 2 &amp; 3, Kitchin, ``Optical Astronomical
Spectroscopy'').

<p>
<B> <A NAME="346">AST346</A> - Galaxies:</B> An introduction to the properties
and contents of galaxies. Topics include the interstellar medium, dust in
galaxies, star formation, galactic dynamics, and the equilibria of
collisionless systems.
The vast and
rapidly developing observational information is presented from a physical
point of view.  The theoretical discussion emphasizes well-established
concepts and avoids more speculative scenarios.  Both our own Milky Way
Galaxy and external galaxies are covered, and a special chapter is devoted
to active galactic nuclei and quasars, the probable sites of massive black
holes.  Prerequisites are AST203 and PHY251.
