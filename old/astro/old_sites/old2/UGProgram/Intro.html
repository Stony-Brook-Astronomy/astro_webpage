<P>
The astronomy program offers a number of courses with no AST
prerequisites but with varying PHY and MAT requirements.  They are listed
below with comparisons and comments on overlap.  Note that AST203 is a
requirement for both the major and minor and that AST101 cannot be taken
for credit as well.

<p>&nbsp;

<P>
<B><A NAME="100">AST100</A> - Astronomy Today:</B> This is a 1 credit
freshman seminar designed to introduce anyone to the excitement of
modern astronomy. We will draw our sources from the recent news, with
emphasis on explaining why the results reported in Newday or the New York
Times are important. Students will be expected to write a paper and
participate in discussions. This course is not appropriate for anyone who
has taken a college-level astronomy course.


<P>
<B> <A NAME="101">AST101</A> - Introduction to Astronomy:</B> This course
emphasizes that part of astronomy beyond the solar system, including stars,
our Galaxy, galaxies and the origin and structure of the universe.  It
requires no University level prerequisites, but will use some quantitative
reasoning (at the high school algebra level).  There is strong overlap in
topics between this course and AST203 and both may not be taken for
credit.  If you are taking or have taken introductory Physics with
Calculus, then we recommend taking AST203.  AST101 is taught every
semester. (Typical text: Bennett, Donahue, Schneider, and Voit, "The Cosmic
Perspective: Stars, Galaxies, Universe".  Satisfies DEC-E).


<P>
<B> <A NAME="105">AST105</A> - Introduction to the Solar System:</B> This
course focuses almost exclusively on the solar system and in particularly
the planets and smaller bodies and is a complement to AST101.  It is taught
at an even more qualitative level, requiring no science background (high
school chemistry would be useful, though) nor mathematics besides simple
proportions and powers.  There is some overlap with material introduced in
AST248, but not so extensively as to exclude taking both.  The course is
taught every semester. (Typical text: Bennett, Donahue, Schneider, and Voit, "The Cosmic
Perspective: The Solar System".  Satisfies DEC-E).


<P>
<B> <A NAME="112">AST112</A> - Astronomy Laboratory:</B> A 1-credit course
coordinated with AST101, AST105 or AST248, one of which must be taken
as a prerequisite or corequisite.  An introduction to observational
activities in astronomy.  Students will make simple astronomical
measurements using instruments such as a quadrant, cross-staff,
spectrometer and telescope.  Offered every semester.  (Typical text:
Robbins, Jefferys, and Shawl, "Discovering Astronomy Activities Manual and
Instrument Kit"). 


<P>
<B> <A NAME="200">AST200</A> - Current Astronomical Research at Stony
Brook:</B> This is a 1 credit
seminar designed to introduce physical science majors to the research
opportunities available in astronomy at Stony Brook. Each week a different
researcher will describe his/her research, and discuss how undergraduates
can participate. This course is intended for majors who plan to do 
research, but is open to anyone with an interest in astronomy.


<P>
<B> <A NAME="203">AST203</A> - Astronomy:</B> 
This is an introduction to astronomy for students with some physics
and calculus preparation.  It touches on some solar system topics but
emphasizes stellar and galactic astronomy and cosmology.  The overlap
of topics with AST101 is sufficient that credit cannot be obtained for
both courses.  AST203 is taught Spring terms only and has a mandatory
recitation section. (Typical text: Kutner, "Astronomy: A Physical
Perspective, 2nd Ed.".  Satisfies DEC-E).


<P>
<B> <A NAME="205">AST205</A> -  Introduction to Planetary Sciences:</B> 
This is an introduction to the solar system for the student with a
background in mathematics or physical sciences. A survey of the
planets, comets, asteroids, and interplanetary medium, based upon the
latest scientific discoveries. There is considerable overlap of
content with AST105; both cannot be taken for credit. AST 205 is
taught alternate Fall semesters.  (Typical text: Cole and Woolfson,
"Planetary Science: The Science of Planets Around Stars"). Satisfies
DEC-E. Required for the AST minor; provides major credit.


<P>
<B> <A NAME="248">AST248</A> - The Search for Life in the Universe:</B>
This course looks at the issues involved in the development of life on
the Earth.  Coupled with our understanding of planet formation
processes and the evolution of stars and galaxies, the course
addresses the question: Is there life elsewhere in the Universe?  As
such, the course draws on some material presented in AST101 and AST105
as well as aspects of Geosciences and Developmental Biology.  While
there is overlap with the two 100 level Astronomy courses, it is not
so extensive as to prevent a student from taking one or the other
prior to AST248.  The course is taught every semester. (Typical text:
Bennett and Shostak, "Life in the Universe, 2nd Ed.".
Satisfies DEC-H).
