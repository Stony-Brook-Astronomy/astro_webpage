<P>&nbsp;
<P>The Department of Physics and Astronomy offers undergraduate
courses in astronomy leading to both a major and, starting in Fall
2002, a minor as well as a variety of courses for the non-scientist.
The major in astronomy leading to a Bachelor of Science degree aims at
giving the student maximum preparation to pursue graduate and
professional work.  The minor in astronomy provides a rigorous
introduction to the discipline without requiring the breadth, and the
corresponding investment of course work, as the major.  A major
leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree in Earth &amp; Space Sciences,
offered through the Geosciences Department is designed to meet the
needs of students who desire a more diverse liberal arts and sciences
background.  It prepares the student to pursue careers in teaching,
law, environmental science, or research.

<p>Requirements for the astronomy major and the minor follow.  Upon
declaring a major, the student will be assigned a faculty advisor, who will
assist in the selection of a course sequence leading to the desired degree.
Advanced students have the opportunity to take courses with relatively
small enrollments and to participate in research programs during the
academic year and summer.

<p><em>Note: requirements may change&mdash;consult the <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/ugrdbulletin/current/">Stony Brook
Undergraduate Bulletin</a> for the official major and minor requirements.</em>

<H2><A NAME="major"> Requirements</A> for the Major</H2>
</DIV>

<P>
All courses taken to meet requirements for the astronomy major must be
taken for a letter grade.  No more than three courses with a grade of
C- may be presented for the major.  Otherwise grades of at least C
must be achieved. A minimum of 60 credits in Astronomy, Mathematics,
and Physics are required. 


<P><H3>A. Required Astronomy Courses:</H3>
AST 203, AST 341, AST 346, AST 347, and
at least six credits from additional AST courses numbered 200
or higher (except AST 248, 301, 304, 389, and 475).  Up to three credits
of AST 287, 447, and 487 may be used toward this requirement. 

<P><H3> B. Required Physics Courses:</H3> 
PHY 131/133, 132/134<SUP>1</SUP>,
PHY 251/252, PHY 277, PHY 300, PHY 306.<BR>

At least 8 credits from other approved
physics-related courses. A list of acceptable courses is maintained by
the Physics Undergraduate Coordinator, and is posted in the Physics
and Astronomy Undergraduate Office.  


<P><H3>C. Mathematics Requirements:</H3>
MAT131, 132<SUP>2</SUP>, MAT203 or 205 or AMS261, MAT303 or 305 or
AMS361. 

<P><H3>D. Upper-Division Writing Requirement:</H3>
All students majoring in astronomy must submit two papers (term
papers, Laboratory reports, or independent research papers) to the
Astronomy Undergraduate Coordinator for department evaluation by
the end of the junior year.  If
this evaluation is satisfactory, the student will have fulfilled the
upper-division writing requirement.  If it is not, the student must
fulfill the requirement before graduation.

<P>&nbsp;
<P>Notes:<BR>
<SUP>1</SUP> PHY 125, 126, 127 or PHY 141, 142 are alternative sequences.
<BR>
<SUP>2</SUP> MAT 125, 126, 127 or MAT 141, 142 are alternative sequences,


<p>&nbsp;

<H2><A NAME="honors">Honors Program</A> in Astronomy</H2>
</DIV>

<P>
Students in the astronomy major who have maintained a cumulative
grade point average of 3.3 through the junior year in courses required for
the major may become candidates for departmental honors in astronomy by
applying to the department.  Candidates for honors must include a sequence
of mathematics, natural science or engineering courses approved by the
student's advisor following petition by the student.

<P>
In addition to the academic program, the student must complete an
honors thesis while enrolled in AST 447 or 487.  The thesis is evaluated
by a committee composed of the student's advisor and two other science
faculty members including one from outside of the department.  If the
honors program is completed with distinction and the student has maintained
a minimum 3.3 grade point average in all course work in natural science,
mathematics and engineering, honors are conferred.

<P>
All courses taken to meet requirements for the astronomy minor
must be passed with a letter grade of C or higher.
Completion of the minor requires 23 to 24 credits.


<P><H3>A. Required Astronomy Courses:</H3>
AST 203 and AST 205, and
any three upper division AST courses (300 level or higher).  No more
than one of these may come from AST 301, 304, or 389.
