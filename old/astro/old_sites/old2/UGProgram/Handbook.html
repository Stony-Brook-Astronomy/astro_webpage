energies between 0.1 and 2.4kev.  The PSPC has a 2 degree wide field of
view; this image is about 4 degrees on a side.  The cluster of X-ray
sources near the center of the image is the RCrA association, a
clustering of stars with ages less than 10 million years.  The bright
source to the lower right is the isolated neutron star RXJ 185635-3754.  A
recent series of measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope has put this

The Department of Physics and Astronomy offers undergraduate
courses in astronomy leading to both a major and, starting in Fall 2001, a
minor as well as a variety of courses for the non-scientist.  The major in
astronomy leading to a Bachelor of Science degree aims at giving the
student maximum preparation to pursue graduate and professional work.  The
minor in astronomy provides a rigorous introduction to the discipline
without requiring the breadth, and the corresponding investment of
course work, as the major.  A major leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree in
Earth &amp; Space Sciences, offered through the Geosciences Department is
designed to meet the needs of students who desire a more diverse liberal
arts and sciences background.  It prepares the student to pursue careers in
teaching, law, environmental science, or research.
<P>
<P>
<BR>
Requirements for the astronomy major and the minor follow.  Upon
declaring a major, the student will be assigned a faculty advisor, who will
assist in the selection of a course sequence leading to the desired degree.
Advanced students have the opportunity to take courses with relatively
small enrollments and to participate in research programs during the
academic year and summer.

The astronomy program offers a number of courses with no AST
prerequisites but with varying PHY and MAT requirements.  They are listed
below with comparisons and comments on overlap.  Note that AST203 is a
requirement for both the major and minor and that AST101 cannot be taken
for credit as well.
<P><P>
<BR>
<P>
<B> AST101 - Introduction to Astronomy:</B> This course
emphasizes that part of Astronomy beyond the Solar System, including Stars,
the Galaxy, Galaxies and the origin and structure of the Universe.  It
requires no University level prerequisites, but will use some quantitative
reasoning (at the high school algebra level).  There is strong overlap in
topics between this course and AST203 and both may not be taken for
credit.  If you are taking or have taken introductory Physics with
Calculus, then we recommend taking AST203.  AST101 is taught every
semester. (Typical text: Robbins, Jefferys, and Shawl, ``Discovering
Astronomy''.  Satisfies DEC-E).
<P><P>
<BR>
<P>
<B> AST105 - Introduction to the Solar System:</B> This course
focuses almost exclusively on the Solar System and in particularly the
Planets and smaller bodies and is a complement to AST101.  It is taught
at an even more qualitative level, requiring no science background (high
school chemistry would be useful, though) nor mathematics besides simple
proportions and powers.  There is some overlap with material introduced in
AST248, but not so extensively as to exclude taking both.  The course is
taught every semester. (Typical text: Morrison and Owen, ``The Planetary
System''.  Satisfies DEC-E). 
<P><P>
<BR>
<P>
<B> AST112 - Astronomy Laboratory:</B> A 1-credit course
coordinated with AST101, AST105 or AST248, one of which must be taken
as a prerequisite or corequisite.  An introduction to observational
activities in astronomy.  Students will make simple astronomical
measurements using instruments such as a quadrant, cross-staff,
spectrometer and telescope.  Offered every semester.  (Typical text:
Robbins, Jefferys, and Shawl, ``Discovering Astronomy Activities Manual and
Instrument Kit''). 
<P><P>
<BR>
<P>
<B> AST203 - Astronomy:</B> This is an Introduction to Astronomy
for students with some Physics and Calculus preparation.  It touches on
some Solar System topics but emphasizes Stellar and Galactic Astronomy and
Cosmology.  The overlap of topics with AST101 is sufficient that credit
cannot be obtained for both courses.  AST203 is taught Fall terms only
and has a mandatory recitation section. (Typical text: Kartunnen et al.,
``Fundamental Astronomy''.  Satisfies DEC-E). 
<P><P>
<BR>
<P>
<B> AST248 - The Search for Life in the Universe:</B> This course
looks at the issues involved in the development of Life on the Earth.
Coupled with our understanding of Planet Formation processes and the
evolution of Stars and Galaxies, the course addresses the question: Is
there life elsewhere in the Universe?  As such, the course draws on some
material presented in AST101 and AST105 as well as aspects of
Geosciences and Developmental Biology.  While there is overlap with the two
100 level Astronomy courses, it is not so extensive as to prevent a student
from taking one or the other prior to AST248.  The course is taught every
semester. (Typical text: Goldsmith and Owen, ``Search for Intelligent Life
in the Universe''.  Satisfies DEC-H).

Below are the undergraduate astronomy courses offered that have
an AST prerequisite.  In addition various reading, research and practicum
in teaching courses are offered on an ``as required'' basis.
<P><P>
<BR>
<P>
<B> AST301 - Collisions in the Solar System:</B> A discussion of
the evidence that comet and asteroid impacts have played a significant part
in the evolution of the Earth and other planets of the solar system, as
well as an assessment of the actual and perceived hazard posed by
terrestrial impacts and discussion of what can be done about it.  The
course will follow an interdisciplinary approach.  Prerequisites include
any two of AST101, 105 or 248 and the first semester of any of the PHY
sequences that require calculus.  It may not be counted for credit toward the
astronomy major.  (Typical text: Chapman and Morrison, ``Cosmic
Catastrophes''.  Satisfies DEC-H). 
<P>
Astronomers have in recent years begun to appreciate the
significance of meteoroid, asteroid and comet impacts with planets in
shaping the evolution of the Solar System.  Such impacts have probably also
played an important role in the evolution of life on the Earth.  This
course explores the role that impacts have played, assesses the hazard that
such impacts pose and considers what might be done about the hazard.
Topics include an overview of the solar system, meteoroids, asteroids and
comets, the terrestrial impact sites, extinction of the dinosaurs, evidence
of periodic mass extinctions, assessment of the risk, and risk reduction
and mitigation.
<P>
<P>
<B> AST341 - Stars and Radiation:</B> An Introduction to, and
development of, a firm physical understanding of the observed properties of
stars.  Particular emphasis will be placed on describing the interaction of
radiation with matter and of the Sun as a typical star.  Prerequisites
include AST203 and PHY251.  PHY306 may be taken before or as a
corequisite.  (Typical text: Bohm-Vitense, ``Introduction to Stellar
Atmospheres'', vols 2 &amp; 3, Kitchin, ``Optical Astronomical
Spectroscopy'').

how we study it: gas dynamics and radiative processes, phases of the
interstellar medium, star and planet formation, explosive phenomena.

<B> AST343 - Galaxies:</B>   An introduction to the properties of galaxies, the main building
blocks of the universe.  The vast and rapidly developing observational
information is presented from a physical point of view.  The theoretical
discussion emphasizes well-established concepts and avoids more speculative
scenarios.  Both our own Milky Way Galaxy and external galaxies are
covered, and a special chapter is devoted to active galactic nuclei and
quasars, the probable sites of massive black holes.  Prerequisites are
AST203 and PHY251.  PHY306 may be taken before or as a corequisite.
