The Department of Physics and Astronomy offers undergraduate
courses in astronomy leading to both a major and, starting in Fall 2002, a
minor as well as a variety of courses for the non-scientist.  The major in
astronomy leading to a Bachelor of Science degree aims at giving the
student maximum preparation to pursue graduate and professional work.  The
minor in astronomy provides a rigorous introduction to the discipline
without requiring the breadth, and the corresponding investment of
course work, as the major.  A major leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree in
Earth &amp; Space Sciences, offered through the Geosciences Department is
designed to meet the needs of students who desire a more diverse liberal
arts and sciences background.  It prepares the student to pursue careers in
teaching, law, environmental science, or research.
<P>
<P>
<BR>
Requirements for the astronomy major and the minor follow.  Upon
declaring a major, the student will be assigned a faculty advisor, who will
assist in the selection of a course sequence leading to the desired degree.
Advanced students have the opportunity to take courses with relatively
small enrollments and to participate in research programs during the
academic year and summer.

<B> <A NAME="major"> Requirements</A> for the Major</B>
<BR>
<P>
All courses taken to meet requirements for the astronomy major
must be taken for a letter grade.  No more than three courses with a grade
of C- may be presented for the major.  Otherwise grades of at
least C must be achieved. A minimum of 60 credits in Astronomy, Mathematics,
and Physics are required.
<BR>
<P>
<B> A. Required Astronomy Courses:</B><BR>
AST203 Astronomy and any three of the following: AST341 Stars and
Radiation, AST346 Galaxies, AST347 Cosmology.
At least six credits from additional AST courses numbered 200
or higher (except AST248, 301, and 304).

<P><P>
<BR>
<P>
Students in the astronomy major who have maintained a cumulative
grade point average of 3.3 through the junior year in courses required for
the major may become candidates for departmental honors in astronomy by
applying to the department.  Candidates for honors must include a sequence
of mathematics, natural science or engineering courses approved by the
student's advisor following petition by the student.
<P>
<BR>
<P>
In addition to the academic program, the student must complete an
honors thesis while enrolled in AST447 or 487.  The thesis is evaluated
by a committee composed of the student's advisor and two other science
faculty members including one from outside of the department.  If the
honors program is completed with distinction and the student has maintained
a minimum 3.3 grade point average in all course work in natural science,
mathematics and engineering, honors are conferred.
