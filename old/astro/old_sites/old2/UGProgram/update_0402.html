<center><b>Update to Stony Brook Astronomy Program, 11 April 2002</b></center>


<b>To:</b> AST majors<br>
<b>From:</b> Prof. F.M. Walter, Astronomy Undergraduate Coordinator<br>
<b>date:</b> 4/11/02<br>
<b>re:</b> Changes in the major<br>

<p>As of the Fall 2002 semester the AST major will be revised.

<p>Graduating seniors: you need not read any further. Congratulations on
completing your degree requirements.

<p>These changes may have some impact on some of your plans for the fall semester,
so you should read this carefully.

<ul>
<li> AST 342, 343, and 344 are to be replaced with a 2 semester sequence,
  AST 346 and AST 347. AST 346 will cover the internal structure of galaxies,
  including the interstellar medium and galactic dynamics. AST 347 will
  cover cosmology, large scale structure, and galaxy formation.

  <p>If you have taken both AST 342 and 343, you cannot take AST 346.
  If you have taken both AST 343 and 344, you cannot take AST 347.

  <p>You are still required to take 3 courses numbered AST 341-347 to complete
  the major.
  AST 341 will be taught, as originally scheduled, in the F02 semester.

<p><li> A new course, Planetary Sciences (AST 205) will be introduced in the F02
  semester, and taught alternate years. It is acceptable for major credit.

<p><li> The requirement for 12 credits in upper division physics is replaced
  with a requirement for 12 credits in approved physics-related courses.
  One course (preferably 3 credits)
  must be in the area of applied numerical computation.
  Anyone who declared a major in astronomy prior to March 22, 2002, is
  grandfathered in to the old requirement (but we still recommend a course
  in applied numerical analysis). I will be making up the list of approved
  courses, so ask me if you have any questions. Basically, any upper division
  PHY course excluding PHY 311 and PHY 313 are acceptable.

  <p>The list of appropriate courses in applied numerical analysis is incomplete.
  We will offer "Introduction to Unix Computing" as AST 287-?? in the Fall.
  This is a 1 or 2 credit course. MEC 111 is another possibility. Please
  talk to the coordinator if you have questions about appropriateness.

<p><li> There has recently been a change in the Physics undergraduate courses
  (see <a
href="http://felix.physics.sunysb.edu/UG/revised-curriculum.html">here</a>).
  PHY 352 has been discontinued, and a new course, PHY 300, is introduced.
  PHY 300 is a prerequisite to PHY 306, and hence becomes a required course
  for the AST major (it satisfies 4 of the 12 required physics elective
  credits). If you have already taken PHY 352, it counts, and you cannot get
  credit for PHY 300.

<p><li> The requirement for graduation is still AST 203 plus the three core
  courses AST 341, 346, 347 (or some combination of 342, 343, 344) plus
  6 AST credits in courses numbered 200 or higher.
  
  <p>You can use AST 205 (3 credits) towards this. Our only other lecture
  course is AST 443 (Observing Techniques). You may take AST 447 (Tutorial)
  or AST 487 (Research) in lieu of these courses.

<p><li> AST 203 will be shifted into the Spring semester. This may cause a problem
  for those of you who will be juniors next year and who have not yet taken
  AST 203. If you are in this group, you should make an appointment to talk
  to me about your schedule. You should take AST 205 in the Fall.

<p><li> Next spring we will introduce a 1 credit seminar, AST 200, describing
  research opportunities in the department. This may be useful for those who
  would like to try a hand at research but don't know where to start.
</ul>

<p>
Over the next two years, we plan to offer the following courses for majors:

<p>AST 447 and 487 are always offered - just find a faculty member to work with.

revisions may impact your plans to graduate with a degree in astronomy.
