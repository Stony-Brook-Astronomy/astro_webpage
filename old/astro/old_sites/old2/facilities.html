<P>Below is a summary of the various facilities members of the
Astronomy group use in their research.  Students working in the group
have acess to all of these.

<P><H2>Local Facilities</H2>

<P><H3>Computer Facilities</H3><br> 

<div class="right">
<img src="cluster_sm.jpg" ALT="WOPR cluster"><br>
the WOPR beowulf cluster
</div>

The department maintains computing facilities, consisting of UNIX
workstations and Linux PCs, for support of data analysis and
theoretical work.  Use of these resources is described in our <A
href="../sysman/">local documentation</A>.  Several faculty have small
beowulf clusters for research.  In addition the University has a 470
processor cluster, <A
HREF="http://www.stonybrook.edu/seawulfcluster/">Seawulf</A>
available for graduate student use.  Stony Brook also is part of the New York Center for Computational Science and together with Brookhaven National Lab run a large IBM Blue Gene/L machine (> 36,000 processors), <A HREF="http://www.bnl.gov/newyorkblue/">New York Blue</A>.

<P><H3>Mount Stony Brook</H3><br> 

The <A href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/observer/mtsb.html">Mount Stony
Brook Observatory</A> is a 14 inch telescope in a dome on the roof of
our building.  This telescope is equipped with a SBIG-6 CCD camera. It
is computer controlled, has an autoguider, and can be operated from a
warmroom. It is currently used for graduate and undergraduate research
projects, as well as for instruction and during <a
href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/openight/opennite.html">Open
Nights</a>


<P><H3>Libraries</H3><br> 
The <A HREF="http://sunysb.edu/library/math/">Mathematics, Physics,
Astronomy Library</A> has a collection covering Astronomy and
Planetary Sciences in addition to Physics and Mathematics. The
collection now numbers over 25,000 books and serials and over 15,000
bound volumes of journals. The library subscribes to 525
journals. Access to databases is available through the Melville
Library bibliographical searching department. The total science
collection includes approximately 250,000 volumes.

<P><H3>Shops</H3><br>

The Department has well equipped electronics and machine shops
employing electronics technicians, machinists, and a number of
computer systems technicians. A research faculty position is dedicated
half time to maintaining and enhancing Astronomical Computing.

the SMARTS telescopes
</div>

<P><H3>SMARTS telescopes</H3><BR>
Stony Brook University is one
of the founding members of the <A HREF="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/fwalter/SMARTS/smarts.html">SMARTS</A> consortium. The SMARTS
consortium was organized to keep open and operating the <a
href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/~whiting/smartspix.html">small
telescopes</a> at the <a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/">Cerro Tololo
Interamerican Observatory</a>. The prime source of information about
SMARTS is the <a href="http://www.astro.yale.edu/smarts/">main SMARTS
web page</a> at Yale university. 

<P><H3>Ground-Based Observatories</H3><br>

Stony Brook astronomers make regular use of the wide array of
instrumentation available to contemporary astronomy. Stony Brook
faculty and graduate students are frequent users of the facilities of
the <a href="http://www.noao.edu/">National Optical Astronomy
Observatories</a> such as the <a
href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/">Cerro Tololo Interamerican
Observatory</a>, the <a href="http://www.nrao.edu/">National Radio Astronomy Observatories</a>, the NASA
<a href="http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/">Infrared Telescope Facility
(IRTF)</a> on Mauna Kea, the <a
href="http://www.nofs.navy.mil/projects/npoi/">Naval Prototype Optical
Interferometer (NPOI)</a>, the <a
href="http://www.gemini.edu/">Gemini</a>, <a
href="http://www.keckobservatory.org/">Keck<a/>, and <a
href="http://iram.fr/">IRAM</a> observatories, and radio and
millimeter wave observatories world-wide.

<P><H3>Space Missions</H3><BR> Stony Brook faculty have been principal
investigators on programs using the <a
href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources/">Hubble Space Telescope
(HST)</a>, the <a
href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/chandra/">Chandra
X-ray Observatory</a>, <a href="http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/">XMM-Newton
X-ray Observatory</a>, and the <a
href="http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> and
are heavily involved in defining the next generation space missions,
such as <a
href="http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/SIM/sim_what_is.cfm">SIM</a>. Faculty
and students routinely use archival data from these and other NASA
missions in the course of their research. Graduate students routinely
participate in analysis of data obtained from these and other
missions, and use these data in the PhD theses.

<P><H3>National Supercomputer Centers</H3><BR> Stony Brook researchers
have large allocations of supercomputer time (several million hours
per year) at the <A HREF="http://www.nersc.gov/">National Energy
Research Scientific Computing Center</A>, the <A
href="http://nccs.gov/">National Center for Computational Sciences</A>,
<A href="http://www.llnl.gov/computing/hpc/resources/OCF_resources.html">
Livermore Computing</A>,
and the <A href="http://www.nas.nasa.gov/">NASA Advanced
Supercomputing Division</A>.  These computers are used mainly for simulations
of supernovae (Type Ia and II), gamma-ray bursts, and other stellar
explosions.
