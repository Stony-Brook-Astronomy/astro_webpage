<P>Below is a summary of the various facilities members of the
Astronomy group use in their research.  Students working in the
Astronomy group have access to all of these.

<P><h1>Local Facilities</h1>

<div class="fac_right">
<img src="images/cluster_sm.jpg" ALT="WOPR cluster"><br>
the WOPR beowulf cluster
</div>

<P><h2>Computer Facilities</h2> 

The department maintains computing facilities, consisting of UNIX
workstations and Linux PCs, for support of data analysis and
theoretical work.  Use of these resources is described in our <A
href="../sysman/">local documentation</A>.  Several faculty have small
beowulf clusters for research.  In addition the University has a 470
processor cluster, <A
HREF="http://www.stonybrook.edu/seawulfcluster/">Seawulf</A> available
for graduate student use.  Stony Brook also is part of the New York
Center for Computational Science and together with Brookhaven National
Lab run a large IBM Blue Gene/L machine (> 36,000 processors), <A
HREF="http://www.bnl.gov/newyorkblue/">New York Blue</A>.

<P><h2>Mount Stony Brook</h2> 

<div class="fac_left">
<img src="images/meade2.png" ALT="Mt. Stony Brook Meade"><br>
the 14&quot; telescope
</div>

The <A href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/observer/mtsb.html">Mount
Stony Brook Observatory</A> consists of a new computerized Meade 14
inch LX200-ACF telescope permanently mounted in a dome on the roof of
our building.  We have 2 CCD cameras (+ filter wheel) and a
spectrograph that can be used with it, as well as an assortment of
eyepieces.  The telescope is currently used for graduate and
undergraduate classes and labs and during our <a
href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/openight/opennite.html">Astronomy
Open Nights</a>.    Additionally, a large number of
smaller 8&quot; telescopes are also available for use.


<p>The roof of the ESS building is designed for
moderate sized crows (~50 people), and students in the 
introductory undergraduate astronomy courses are frequently
invited up for viewing.

<P><h2>Libraries</h2> 
The <A HREF="http://sunysb.edu/library/math/">Mathematics, Physics,
Astronomy Library</A> has a collection covering Astronomy and
Planetary Sciences in addition to Physics and Mathematics. The
collection now numbers over 25,000 books and serials and over 15,000
bound volumes of journals. The library subscribes to 525
journals. Access to databases is available through the Melville
Library bibliographical searching department. The total science
collection includes approximately 250,000 volumes.

<P><h2>Shops</h2>

The Department has well equipped electronics and machine shops
employing electronics technicians, machinists, and a number of
computer systems technicians. A research faculty position is dedicated
half time to maintaining and enhancing Astronomical Computing.

<P><h1>External Facilities</h1>



<P><h2>Palomar 5 m Hale Telescope</h2>

<P>
<div class="fac_left">
<img src="images/p200inch_sm.jpg" ALT="Hale 5 m"><br>
Palomar 5 m Hale Telescope
</div>

The Stony Brook Physics & Astronomy Department is a 6% partner in the
<a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/index.html">Palomar 5 m
Hale telescope</a>.  The Hale telescope offers a full range of imaging
and spectroscopic capabilities from the optical to the mid-infrared,
and is equipped with a natural guide-star adaptive optics system for
high contrast, high angular resolution imaging.  Together with
Caltech, JPL, and the AMNH, Stony Brook is also a member of the
Palomar extreme adaptive optics upgrade collaboration.  The updated
adaptive optics system, <a href="http://ao.jpl.nasa.gov/Palm3K/Palm3KIndex.html">PALM3000</a>, is expected to
attain unprecedented imaging contrast in the near-infrared and to
allow diffraction-limited imaging with the Hale in the optical.


<P>
<div class="fac_right">
<img src="images/102-0211_t.jpg" ALT="SMARTS telescopes"><br>
the SMARTS telescopes
</div>

<P><h2>SMARTS telescopes</h2>
Stony Brook University is one
of the founding members of the <A HREF="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/fwalter/SMARTS/smarts.html">SMARTS</A> consortium. The SMARTS
consortium was organized to keep open and operating the <a
href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/~whiting/smartspix.html">small
telescopes</a> at the <a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/">Cerro Tololo
Interamerican Observatory</a>. The prime source of information about
SMARTS is the <a href="http://www.astro.yale.edu/smarts/">main SMARTS
web page</a> at Yale university. 

<P><h2>Ground-Based Observatories</h2>

Stony Brook astronomers make regular use of the wide array of
instrumentation available to contemporary astronomy. Stony Brook
faculty and graduate students are frequent users of the facilities of
the <a href="http://www.noao.edu/">National Optical Astronomy
Observatories</a> such as the <a
href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/">Cerro Tololo Interamerican
Observatory</a>, the <a href="http://www.nrao.edu/">National Radio Astronomy Observatories</a>, the NASA
<a href="http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/">Infrared Telescope Facility
(IRTF)</a> on Mauna Kea, the <a
href="http://www.nofs.navy.mil/projects/npoi/">Naval Prototype Optical
Interferometer (NPOI)</a>, the <a
href="http://www.gemini.edu/">Gemini</a>, <a
href="http://www.keckobservatory.org/">Keck</a>, and <a
href="http://iram.fr/">IRAM</a> observatories, the
<a href="http://www.mmarray.org/">Combined Array for Research
in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA)</a>, the <a href="http://www.nro.nao.ac.jp/index-e.html">Nobeyama 45m telescope</a>, and the <a href="http://www.naoj.org/">Subaru telescope</a>.

<P><h2>Space Missions</h2>

Stony Brook faculty have been principal investigators on programs
using the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources/">Hubble Space
Telescope (HST)</a>, the <a
href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/chandra/">Chandra
X-ray Observatory</a>, <a href="http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/">XMM-Newton
X-ray Observatory</a>, <a href="http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=16">Herschel telescope</a> and the <a
href="http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> and
are heavily involved in defining the next generation space missions,
such as <a
href="http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/SIM/sim_what_is.cfm">SIM</a>. Faculty
and students routinely use archival data from these and other NASA
missions in the course of their research. Graduate students routinely
participate in analysis of data obtained from these and other
missions, and use these data in the PhD theses.

<P><h2>National Supercomputer Centers</h2>

Stony Brook researchers have large allocations of supercomputer time
(10s of million of CPU-hours per year) at the <A
HREF="http://www.nersc.gov/">National Energy Research Scientific
Computing Center</A>, the <A href="http://nccs.gov/">National Center
for Computational Sciences</A>, <A
href="http://www.llnl.gov/computing/hpc/resources/OCF_resources.html">
Livermore Computing</A>, the <a
href="http://www.alcf.anl.gov/">Argonne Leadership Computing
Facility</a> and the <A href="http://www.nas.nasa.gov/">NASA Advanced
Supercomputing Division</A>.  These computers are used mainly for
simulations of supernovae (Type Ia and II), gamma-ray bursts, and
other stellar explosions.
