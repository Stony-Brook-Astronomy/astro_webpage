<hr>
   Amid the rolling hills of Long Island's north shore, the State
University of New York at Stony Brook campus spreads out over 1,100
acres of heavily wooded countryside.  Located at the border of suburban
and rural Long Island, equidistant from the western and eastern ends,
Stony Brook students enjoy the best of many worlds.  The University is
less than 60 miles from Manhattan which is easily accessible by train
or car.  At the same time, the tranquility of Long Island's rural areas
and seashores are adjacent to the campus.  Stony Brook lies about a
mile from the shores of Long Island Sound, and less than 15 miles from
the wide sandy beaches of the Atlantic on Fire Island, Long Island's
southern coast.  The many miles of seashore, in addition to the state
and national parklands, offer ample opportunities for recreation. 

<p> Although the University was established in 1957, its present form began
to emerge during a period of rapid growth in the late 1960's and early
1970's. Within the past few years, the University's size has stabilized and
comprises approximately 1,700 faculty and 17,700 students of whom 10,000 are
full time undergraduates and 6,000 are graduate students.  Academic
buildings, laboratories, and libraries form the nucleus of the campus.
These are surrounded by six residential quadrangles and athletic fields and
facilities.  In 1980, University Hospital was opened, a 540-bed
research/teaching hospital that is the focus of Stony Brook's medical and
nursing programs.

<p>   Within the past 30 years Stony Brook has formed many departments
and programs that have attained highly regarded national and
international reputations.  This is especially true within the 
Physical Sciences, which includes the Departments of Chemistry,
GeoSciences, Mathematics, and Physics and Astronomy.  As a result, Stony
Brook attracts faculty and students of the highest caliber from across
the continent and the world.
