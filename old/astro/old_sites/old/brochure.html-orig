\centerline{\bf THE UNIVERSITY}
\bigskip
  Amid the rolling hills of Long Island's north shore, the State University of 
New York at Stony Brook campus spreads out over 1,100 acres of heavily wooded 
countryside.  Located at the border of suburban and rural Long Island, 
equidistant from the western and eastern ends, Stony Brook students enjoy the 
best of many worlds.  The University is less than 60 miles from Manhattan which 
is easily accessible by train or car.  At the same time, the tranquility of 
Long Island's rural areas and seashores are adjacent to the campus.  Stony 
Brook lies about a mile from the shores of Long Island Sound, and less than 15 
miles from the wide sandy beaches of the Atlantic on Fire Island, Long Island's 
southern coast.  The many miles of seashore, in addition to the state and 
national parklands, offer ample opportunities for recreation.
\medskip

     Although the University was established in 1957, its present form began to 
emerge during a period of rapid growth in the late 1960's and early 1970's.  
Within the past few years, the University's size has stabilized and comprises 
approximately 1,300 faculty and 16,000 students of whom 5,000 are graduate 
students.  Academic buildings, laboratories, and libraries form the nucleus of 
the campus.  These are surrounded by six residential quadrangles and athletic 
fields and facilities.  In 1980, University Hospital was opened, a 540-bed 
research/teaching hospital that is the focus of Stony Brook's medical and 
nursing programs.
\medskip

     Within the past 20 years Stony Brook has formed many departments and 
programs that have attained highly regarded national and international 
reputations.  This is especially true within the Division of Physical Sciences, 
which includes the Departments of Chemistry, Earth and Space Sciences, 
Mathematics, and Physics.  As a result, Stony Brook attracts faculty and 
students of the highest caliber from across the continent and the world.

\cl{\bf THE DEPARTMENT}
\bigskip
     The Astronomy Program at Stony Brook is a part of the Department of Earth 
and Space Sciences.  The Astronomy Program comprises nine full-time 
astronomers on the faculty, a varying number of
visiting and  adjunct faculty, two or three postdoctoral 
researchers, and about fifteen graduate students pursuing advanced study
in various areas of astronomy.  There are 16 other full-time faculty 
 in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences.
 These are in various areas of geology
and include faculty with interests in planetary geology and
meteoritics.  There are active collaborations 
between the astronomers and
faculty and graduate students in the Mechanical Engineering (Atmospheric 
Sciences) and Physics Departments as well as with physicists at the
Brookhaven National Laboratory which is situated about 20 miles east of
the campus.
\medskip

     Stony Brook astronomers make regular use of the wide array of 
instrumentation available to contemporary astronomy. Stony Brook faculty and 
graduate students are particularly frequent users of the facilities of the 
National Optical Astronomy Observatories and the National Radio Astronomy 
Observatories (in the past year SUNY-SB joined the AURA Board), the 
observatories at Mauna Kea, use data obtained by the space observatories (most 
notably Einstein, IRAS, and IUE) and participate in national and international 
missions to the planets.  Several of the faculty participate in consortia 
proposing to use the Hubble Space Telescope.  Stony Brook astronomers 
participate in a time sharing agreement to use the FCRAO 14-meter millimeter 
wave antenna.
\medskip

     Excellent modern computing facilities for support of data analysis and 
theoretical work are available at Stony Brook.  By campus network, the 
astronomers use the Computing Center's VAX-8600 and IBM-3083,
 the Theoretical Physics' 
VAX-780, and their own micro-VAX II.
Researchers also have direct access to the Cornell and Princeton Supercomputer 
Centers and use the computing facilities at Brookhaven, and the Los Alamos and 
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories.
  Various terminals and I/O devices are 
available in the astronomers' labs and offices.  The University operates a 
research grade library with a branch located in the ESS building.  Its 
astronomy collection is extensive and kept up to date.  The Department has well 
equipped electronics and machine shops for the support of research activities.
\medskip

     The  average number of graduate students in the Astronomy 
Program at Stony Brook is about 15.  The department strives to support fully 
all graduate students in good academic standing.  A wide range of research 
grant support (research assistantships) and university support (fellowships
 and teaching 
assistantships) allow attainment of that goal, both for the academic year and 
summer.  Students follow a course of study that is both broadly based and 
topical, and are encouraged to participate in research as early in their 
graduate careers as is possible.  Stony Brook's astronomy graduate program is 
distinguished by the number of Ph.D. students who have taken positions at 
universities and research laboratories across the nation.

For several years now I have been involved in finding the place of the sun 
among the stars.  My observations have led to an improvement of planetary 
photometry, to a long overdue improvement of our knowledge of the solar         
spectral irradiance, and to a revision of the MK system of classification.

Presently I am looking for observational clues to large-scale interior mixing.  
Correlating carbon abundances from IUE spectra of a hundred main-sequence 
B-stars to rotational velocities turned out to be inconclusive so far.

Recently I became fascinated with the more fundamental aspects of science, for 
example the question of whether the concept of gravitational mass was ever 
necessary.  This kindled my interest in history of science from Ptolemy to 
Newton.

{\bf Current Research}

My research interests concentrate on exploring connections between interstellar 
gas and dust, star and planet formation, and the early solar system.

Our group is using infrared spectroscopy to study the interstellar medium.  
Recent results show that methane, CH{$_4$}, is rare in most interstellar 
clouds, but carbonaceous material is found in solids in the interstellar 
grains.  We hope that a picture of interstellar carbon chemistry will emerge 
from this research.

Part of the program has been the investigation of the composition of comets 
which are believed to be primitive objects perhaps incorporating interstellar 
material in relatively unaltered forms.  We are studying the dark, carbonaceous 
material that covers the nuclei of comets, including that of comet Halley.  
This material may be related to interstellar carbon and be the source of much 
of the carbon found on Earth.

We are investigating the abundances and distributions of CO, C{$_2$}H{$_6$}, 
C{$_3$}H{$_2$}, GeH{$_4$}, and D on Jupiter and Saturn.  A recently completed 
Ph.D. thesis project clarified the origin of Jovian CO and the oxygen 
abundance.  These abundances provide clues to the properties of the gases and 
solids out of which the planets formed.

Our group uses observing facilities at Mauna Kea, Kitt Peak, Cerro Tololo, and 
the Kuiper Airborne Observatory.  The observations are primarily based on the 
infrared region of the spectrum and incorporate spectroscopy, polarimetry, and 
photometry.

My major research interests deal with the interaction between nuclear theory 
and some outstanding problems in astrophysics.  The chief emphasis of this 
program is on stellar collapse, Type II supernovae, neutron star formation, and 
neutrino astrophysics.  Central to these topics are the development of an 
equation of state of hot, dense matter and numerical simulations of 
gravitational collapse and neutron star birth.  We are using general 
relativistic hydrodynamical models with detailed neutrino 
transport and the LLPR 
(Lattimer, Lamb, Pethick, and Ravenhall) equation of state (see 2,3 below).

We are modeling not only the stellar collapse leading up to supernova, but also 
the quasi-static deleptonization and cooling of the nascent neutron star. 
 Our studies 
of neutrinos in  stellar collapse and neutron star formation concentrate on 
their detectability and signatures, as neutrinos are the only direct probe of 
collapse and early supernova dynamics.  The recent detection of neutrinos from 
SN 1987a has spectacularly confirmed predictions from current supernova models.

I have been interested for some time in the question of whether or not 
supernovae produce large quantities of dust.  There is a school of thought 
which predicts they are the only way to form and preserve the tremendous 
interstellar gas phase depletions of elements such as Ca, Ti, Mg, etc.  Once 
again, SN 1987a may present us with a test of these ideas.

I am also currently pursuing investigations into the origin of meteorites, 
especially carbonaceous and enstatite chondrites.  This is done with the aid of 
chemical equilibrium condensation simulations including all minerals and solid 
solutions for which data is known or has been reasonably estimated.  Details of 
the environment and formation location of these primitive meteorites will 
hopefully emerge, together with an understanding of the early evolution of the 
pre-solar nebula.

My research interests concern dynamical problems in astrophysics, especially 
those related to the solar system.  I have worked extensively on analyzing the 
structure of Saturn's rings and on ring-moon interactions; this research is     
ongoing.  I am currently working to better characterize the radial and 
azimuthal structure of the Uranian rings using Voyager stellar occultation 
data.  I also intend to continue my studies of Neptune's arc rings when the 
Voyager spacecraft encounters that planet.

One of my main interests is the formation of the solar system.  I have recently 
written a review article on how observations of planetary rings and moons can 
be used to constrain conditions in the protoplanetary disk.  The cratering 
record can be used as an indirect observation of debris swept up in the last 
stages of the accretion process.  I have analyzed the cratering record on 
Saturn's moons in order to estimate the flux of stray debris and to assess the 
hypothesis that Saturn's smaller moons may have been catastrophically disrupted 
and re-accreted early in the history of the solar system.  I am continuing this 
work with studies of the Galilean Satellites of Jupiter and Earth's Moon.

The problem central to planetary accretion is the formation of Jupiter.  Growth 
of the Jovian core by solid body accretion, followed by gravitational trapping 
of nebular gas, offers the most attractive scenario.  However, in most models, 
core accretion times range from 5 {$\times$} 10{$^{7}$} to 5 {$\times$} 10{$^{8}$} years, whereas 
the gas in the solar nebula is likely to have been dispersed by the energetic 
T-Tauri stage solar wind in a few {$\times$} 10{$^{6}$} years.  I have found that under 
a restricted range of nebula conditions, Jupiter's core could have grown via 
runaway accretion in {$\approx$}10{$^{6}$} years, and the rest of the current 
planetary system can also be accounted for.  I am now studying the 
cross-sections in the 3-body problem in order to better estimate runaway 
accretion rates.

I am also interested in dynamical problems outside the solar system.  I am 
currently developing models of two types of circumstellar disks: the disk 
surrounding the {$\epsilon$} Aurigae secondary and the dust disks observed 
around nearby stars by IRAS.  These latter disks are especially intriguing 
because they may have many properties in common with the protoplanetary disk.

My research is centered on observations of planets, satellites, and comets with 
Earth-based and Earth-orbiting telescopes and with experiments on spacecraft.

As a member of the Imaging Science Team on the NASA Voyager mission, I have 
been studying the outer planets and their satellites as the spacecraft 
successively encountered them.  The next target is Neptune, to be reached in 
August, 1989.  I am also a member of the mass spectrometer teams on the Galileo 
and CRAF missions and an Interdisciplinary Scientist on Galileo.  I am working 
on a cooperative mission between ESA and NASA that will send an orbiter and 
Titan probe to the Saturn system, if it is approved by both agencies.

The program of ground-based studies uses IR spectroscopy and some radio 
observations to determine the composition and structure of planetary 
atmospheres. Recent results include the discovery of HDO on Mars and an 
evaluation of D/H in the atmospheres of the outer planets
and Titan.  The high value of D/H on Mars implies a warm early
atmosphere, while the enrichment on Titan and 
Uranus may indicate that one or more isolated, low-temperature reservoirs of 
deuterium exist in the outer solar system with values of D/H established prior 
to solar system formation.  Current projects include CH$_{_3}$D on Neptune, a   
systematic study of Jupiter's Great Red Spot at 5 and 10 {\mum}, and            
investigations of comets and Titan from 2-4 {\mum}.  In another program, 
laboratory studies of the trapping of gases by low temperature ice carried out 
by A. Bar-Nun and colleagues at Tel-Aviv are being applied to problems 
concerning the volatile content of comets and the 
origins of planetary atmospheres.

My research effort is presently aimed at pinning down the distance modulus of 
the Hyades and, if possible, the Pleiades and the Praesepe distance moduli as 
well.  The approach is to combine both high angular resolution and 
spectroscopic data on intermediate period binaries to evaluate `orbital' 
parallaxes.

The high angular resolution data needed for this purpose is a combination of 
speckle interferometry obtained from the literature and lunar occultation data 
obtained by myself and collaborators.  The occultation data accumulates slowly 
and to date is primarily useful in providing additional observational 
constraints on existing binary systems.  The spectroscopic data on systems in 
the appropriate period range have been obtained over a five year period and are 
being reduced.  The combined observational data have already yielded very 
useful results.  We have found the published period for Finsen 342 to be 
spurious.  When this and several smaller effects are corrected, we have revised
McClure's recent distance modulus for the Hyades from 3.47 mag down to 3.36. 
 We 
are re-examining the visual binaries used by McClure for possible spurious 
orbits (one or two more cases are a distinct possibility) and are adding 
spectroscopic material to augment other cases.  We expect this to yield a 
cluster distance modulus with an uncertainty of only a few hundredths of a 
magnitude, a determination that depends only on the validity of Newton's laws.

With the announcement that the MMT mirrors can be optically phased for up to 10 
minutes at a time comes the opportunity of resolving objects on a scale of 15 
milliarcseconds.  This should allow at least two of the Hyades spectroscopic 
binaries to be resolved over a substantial fraction of their orbits.  We expect 
to obtain real `orbital' parallaxes for these systems in a year's time.

I am interested in star formation in the Milky Way and in other galaxies.  
To study young stars at high angular resolution, I am obtaining lunar 
occultation data in the IR.  It is possible to achieve resolutions              
corresponding to {$\approx$}1 AU at the distance of the Taurus and Ophiuchus    
associations. In several instances, extended dusty structures 
have been resolved.  Thus far, 
the binary frequency in the sample of some 25 young stars observed seems 
normal. 

I also study obscured young objects by high resolution infrared spectroscopy.   
Diagnostics involving a variety of lines in the IR have been identified to      
probe the diverse physical conditions near the central young star, at its       
accretion disk, and at comparatively greater distances from the star.  In at 
least one case, that of MWC 349 (which however may not be young), clear 
spectroscopic evidence for a disk is found.

As the opportunities occur, I am also applying the occultation technique
 in the IR to objects of particular
interest.  Thus, for example, I am involved in a 
campaign to observe the current series of occultations of the galactic center.

To study the IRAS galaxy phenomenon, I am using the IRAS database and optical data to determine the infrared and optical luminosity functions of IRAS 
galaxies and to compare the optical and environmental characteristics of IRAS 
and non-IRAS galaxies.The optical luminosity function of the IRAS galaxies in our sample shows that 
in the magnitude range -22 {$<$} M{$_J$} {$<$} -18, IRAS galaxies represent 
about 15{$\%$} of field galaxies.  At low optical luminosities,
 M{$_J$} {$>$}-19 
 mag, there may be a deficiency of IRAS galaxies relative to the field galaxies.

{\bf Current Research}
\smallskip

My astronomical research during the past five years has centered on 
observations of the physical properties and galactic distribution of star 
forming molecular clouds in the Milky Way and external 
galaxies.  In 1978 I named these objects 
Giant Molecular Clouds (GMC's) based on an analysis of the first 
high resolution maps of the galactic plane in CO emission, 
which systematically measured 
their size and mass.  The molecular observations, primarily 
of millimeter wave CO 
emissions, have been carried out at the FCRAO 14 meter Mm Wave Antenna 
through a time-sharing agreement.The Massachusetts-Stony Brook CO Galactic      
Plane Survey was a major product of this time-sharing.  
At Stony Brook we have carried out a systematic analysis 
of 300 galactic molecular clouds leading to the following conclusions: 1) 
The velocity linewidth of GMC's is proportional to the 0.5 
power of the size; 2) The virial mass-CO luminosity law for giant GMC's is     
{\sl M} {$\propto$} ({\sl L}{$_C$}{$_O$}){$^0$}{$^.$}{$^8$}{$^1$}.  The total 
mass of the molecular clouds between {\sl R} = 2 {\sl kpc} and the solar circle 
is 2.0 {$\times$} 10{$^9$} {$\sm$}; 3)
 The mass-CO luminosity calibration is proportional to the square root of   
the mean density of the clouds and inversely proportional to the temperature;   
4) Molecular clouds are in or near virial equilibrium; 5) the cloud CO          
luminosity is {\sl L}{$_C$}{$_O$} {$\propto$} {$\sigma$}{$_\upsilon$}{$^5$}.
Current research uses the far infrared IRAS images to determine the 
star formation activity, particularly the OB star formation rate in GMC's.

We have also had an extensive program of extragalactic CO observations.  The    
far IR to CO ratio is on average seven times higher for closely interacting
 or merging galaxies     
than for isolated galaxies.  This effect is due in part to increased star       
formation efficiencies in merging galaxies. For the IR luminous galaxies the    
ratio of FIR to CO (molecular mass) is higher than for any cloud in the Milky   
Way.

I have also been engaged in a program of observations of stratospheric trace 
constituents in the ozone layer utilizing the techniques of millimeter wave 
astronomy.  We recently returned from a highly successful expedition to 
Antarctica where we found evidence that chlorofluorocarbons are involved in the  
Antarctic Ozone Hole.

{\bf Current Research}

    My two main areas of research are cosmology and supernovae.  Work on
supernovae is done in collaboration with Professor Lattimer, and is
elaborated by him.  The description below relates to my cosmological
research.  Additional areas of interest include galactic structure and
molecular clouds.
 
    A major unknown in cosmology is the value of the mean mass-energy density
of the Universe.  This parameter is important not only to astrophysics, but
also to theories of elementary particle physics, dealing with baryogenesis
and the possible inflationary phase of the early Universe.  The method I use
to determine the mean density is to relate the so-called peculiar velocities
(deviations from the pure Hubble expansion of the Universe) to the density
perturbations which have caused them.  Current work concentrates on a sample
of infrared selected galaxies, for which my collaborators and I have obtained
redshifts.  This sample, which covers 85{$\%$} of the sky, is the most complete
and homogeneous catalog of galaxies with recession velocities {$<$}     
10,000 km s{$^-$}{$^1$}.

\cl{\bf GRADUATE EDUCATION PROGRAM}
\bigskip
\bigskip

The purpose of the Stony Brook Astronomy Graduate Program is to provide a 
foundation in basic astronomy and astrophysics through a combination of course 
work and independent research projects during the first two years.  In the last 
two or three years, the student is primarily involved in carrying out 
research that will lead to a doctoral dissertation.

\medskip
The courses include: Galactic and Extragalactic Astronomy, Interstellar Matter, 
Stellar Interiors, Cosmology, Stellar Atmospheres, Planetary Atmospheres and 
Astronomical Techniques.  In addition, at least one advanced topic seminar is 
held every year.  Recent topics have included Star Formation, Cosmic Rays,
Molecular Radio Astronomy, Saturn, Galaxy Formation, and Comets.
 Students are also required to take basic graduate level 
physics courses in Electricity and Magnetism, Statistical Mechanics, and 
Quantum Mechanics.  For those students who enter the program without a strong 
physics background, we recommend upper-level undergraduate physics courses.

\medskip
The Ph.D. Preliminary Examination is given near the end of a student's fourth 
semester.  It consists of a written exam covering the material covered in the 
graduate courses and an oral exam testing the student's comprehension of basic 
ideas in Astronomy.  Advancement into the Ph.D. program is based on the results 
of this examination combined with the student's performance in courses.  
Students who fail this examination generally complete their education here with 
a Master's Degree.  Following successful completion of the Preliminary 
Examination, students generally spend the next six months choosing a thesis 
topic and advisor.  They are then required to submit a thesis proposal.  In 
practice this often takes one year from the completion of the Ph.D. preliminary 
Exam.  The student is given an oral examination on the thesis proposal and 
advanced to candidacy.  


\medskip
The thesis research covers a wide variety of topics in observational and 
theoretical astronomy.  Ph.D. theses that have been completed in the last five 
years are listed below.
