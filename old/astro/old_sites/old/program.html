The Astronomy Program at Stony Brook was formed in 1968 as part of the
Department of Earth and Space Sciences and administratively moved in 1998
to what is now the Department of Physics and Astronomy.  Since its
inception, the program has expanded into broad areas of galactic and
extragalactic astronomy, nuclear astrophysics, stellar astrophysics, and
cosmology.  It offers strong undergraduate programs leading to the
baccalauareate and graduate programs leading to the Master of Science and
Doctor of Philosophy.  Currently, the program has nine full-time astronomy
faculty, several visiting and adjunct faculty,and two to three postdoctoral
researchers.  The faculty has developed a significant diversity of
interests, has earned an international reputation, and can provide students
with opportunities for study and research in many fields.  Courses taken by
undergraduate Astronomy majors are characterized by their small size,
rarely are enrollments over 10, and their intimate character.  Instruction
and learning take place in nearly optimal circumstances.  Graduates of the
program go on to the best graduate programs or are very competitive for
techical positions in industry.

<p>The Graduate Program currently has about 10-15 M.S. and Ph.D. students
actively working in Astronomical research areas, and adds three to five new
students each year.  The emphasis is on a rigorous program of study and
research in astrophysics leading to the Ph.D. degree, but we also offer
opportunities for students with educational goals culminating at the
master's level.  Students follow a course of study that is both broadly
based and topical, and are encouraged to participate in research with the
faculty from the beginning of their graduate careers.  Stony Brook's
Astronomy Program is distinguished by the number of Ph.D. students who have
taken positions at universities and research laboratories around the
world.

<p>The first two years of the graduate program emphasizes coursework but
also includes research or individual study courses in which the student
works closely with a faculty member, often on a potential thesis topic.
Upon completion of the courses, the student takes a qualifying examination
for the master's degree and/or for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree.  The
Ph.D. candidate, together with a faculty advisor, then develops a topic for
thesis research.  Students may elect either theoretical or observational
subjects, according to their own and their advisor's interests.  Average
time from entrance into graduate school to completion of the Ph.D. degree
is five and a half years.
