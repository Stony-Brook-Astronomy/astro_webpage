Financial support for undergraduates is primarily provided through the
university and its various resources.  Some faculty hire undergraduates to
help with their research projects, particularly during the summer months
and mostly during the latter two years of the undergraduate program.

<p>In the graduate program the department strives to support fully all
graduate students in good academic standing.  A wide range of research
grant support (research assistantships) and university support (fellowships
and teaching assistantships) is available.  Students also receive support
from national fellowships such as those from NSF and NASA and from Stony
Brook Graduate Fellowships.  In the past, the Program has generally
supported all eligible students.  Salaries and stipends are competetive
with those at other U.S. universities.
