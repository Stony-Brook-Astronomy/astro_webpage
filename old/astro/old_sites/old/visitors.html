<h2>Air Travel Recommendations</h2>

<p>
The closest airport is 
<a href="http://www.macarthurairport.com"> 
Long Island MacArthur Airport</a> (airport designator ISP)
at Islip NY which is about 16 miles & 25 minutes from 
Stony Brook.  This is a regional airport served
by major carriers such as American, Continental, Delta, Southwest,
and US Airways.   Southwest has direct flights
from/to BWI and Chicago Midway.

<p>
It is also possible to fly into LaGuardia (airport designator LGA) or
JFK (airport designator JFK) or Newark NJ (airport designator EWR)
but the travel from Stony Brook
to these airports is typically lengthy (a minimum of 1.5 hours 
for JFK & LGA and 2.5 hours for EWR ) because of heavy
metropolitan area traffic.
More info about NY area metropolitan airports
is available at the <a href="http://www.panynj.gov/aviation.html">
