<H2>Ground-Based Observatories</H2> 

Stony Brook astronomers make regular use of the wide array of
instrumentation available to contemporary astronomy. Stony Brook faculty
and graduate students are frequent users of the facilities of the National
Optical Astronomy Observatories (both the Kitt Peak National Observatory
and the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory), the National Radio
Astronomy Observatories, the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on
Mauna Kea, and radio and millimeter wave observatories world-wide.

<p>Stony Brook operates a 14" telescope on the roof of the Earth & Space
Sciences building. This telescope is equipped with a SBIG-6 CCD camera. It
is computer controlled, has an autoguider, and can be operated from a
warmroom.  It is currently used for graduate and undergraduate research
projects, as well as for instruction.  Arrangements are being made to
install the University's Ealing 24" reflector at a high quality local site.


<H2>Space Missions</H2><p>

Stony Brook faculty have been principal investigators on programs using the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the Einstein, ROSAT, and ASCA X-ray
observatories, and the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) and are
heavily involved in defining the next generation space missions, such as
SIM.  Faculty and students routinely use archival data from these and other
NASA missions in the course of their research.  Graduate students routinely
participate in analysis of data obtained from these and other missions, and
use these data in the PhD theses.

<H2>Computer Facilities</H2> 

<p> The department maintains computing facilities, consisting of VMS and
UNIX workstations and Linux PCs, for support of data analysis and
theoretical work.  Researchers also have direct access to the Cornell and
Princeton Supercomputer Centers and use the computing facilities at
Brookhaven and the Los Alamos and Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratories.

<H2>Libraries</H2>

<p>The Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy Library has a collection covering
Astronomy and Planetary Sciences in addition to Physics and Mathematics.
The collection now numbers over 25,000 books and serials and over 15,000
bound volumes of journals.  The library subscribes to 525 journals.  Access
to databases is available through the Melville Library bibliographical
searching department.  The total science collection includes approximately
250,000 volumes.

<H2>Shops</H2>

<p>The Department has well equipped electronics and machine shops employing
electronics technicians, machinists, and a number of computer systems
technicians.  A research faculty position is dedicated half time to
maintaining and enhancing Astronomical Computing.
