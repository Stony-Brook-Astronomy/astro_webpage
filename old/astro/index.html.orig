The close pair T Tau Sa-Sb, detected only in the infrared, lies less than an arc sec to the south of T Tau (N).  In order to measure the mass of this binary, Gail Schaefer, Tracy Beck, Lisa Prato, and Mike Simon have been measuring its orbital motion using AO techniques at the Gemini and Keck Observatories.  The apparent orbit in the figure is centered on T Tau Sa.  It is too soon to determine the orbital parameters definitively, possible orbits having periods of 30, 40, and 50yr are shown, but already we know that T Tau Sa is the most massive member of the triple.  The T Tau system is of great interest and not all the astrometric data in the figure is ours; some of the points are taken from the literature.<br><br><em>Astronomical contest:<\/em> Estimate the orbital period of T Tau Sa-Sb.  Email your entries to Mike Simon.  The estimate closest to the final value submitted before 24:00h EST on Dec. 31, 2011 will receive an acknowledgement in our definitive paper presenting the orbital parameters of the pair.";

Taken in 2007, this is the earliest detection of all three planets in the so far only directly imaged multi-planet system.  Combined with more recent images taken in 2008 and 2009, these data clearly demonstrate the orbital motions of all three planets.  Planets b, c, and d revolve around HR 8799 along nearly face-on oriented orbits, at separations of 68, 37, and 24 AU, respectively, with corresponding orbital periods of approximately 450 years, 190 years, and 98 years.  Each planet is about 100,000 times fainter than HR 8799 (which has been masked out); the projected angular separations between the planets and the star are 0.6-1.7 arc seconds."

After a few hours of aligning the telescope, and calibrating the CCD, they took this image of M42 (The Great Orion Nebula).  This image is created by taking multiple exposures of the nebula in 3 different filters, normalizing them, and combining them to create a false color image.  The colors in the image are comprised by three filters, Hydrogen alpha for red, V for green, and B for blue.";
