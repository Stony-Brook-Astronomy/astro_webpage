  text = "<b>Faculty Advisor:</b>Prof. Stanimir Metchev<br /><b>Club President:</b> Matthew Wahl (aKa The Fearless Leader)<br /> <b>Club Vice President:</b> Adam Siegel (aKa The Duke)<br /> <b>Club Treasurer:</b> Shannon Hicks (aKa: Kix)<br /> <b>Club Secretary:</b> Jonathan Ullmann (aKa Bandanna Kid) <br /><b>Adjunct Telescope Guru:</b> Evan Rothstein (aKa That Kid With The Long Hair)"

  Stan = "<b>Prof. Stanimir Metchev:</b>The faculty advisor for the club is an assistant professor in the Astronomy department at Stony Brook. Prof. Metchev recieved his Ph.D in astrophysics from Cal-Tech and is currently doing research in brown dwarfs, extrasolar planets, circumstellar disks, planet formation and evolution, as well as adaptive optics."

  Matt = "<b>Matthew Wahl : </b>The club President is currently a senior pursuing a double major in physics and astronomy.  He is also currently doing research with Prof. Jin Koda.  His research area is in galactic radio astronomy, and has just recently completed a catalog of molecular clouds in the Milky Way galaxy which he presented at the Winter 2010 AAS Meeting. In the summer of 2010, he pursued reasearch at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Virginia. The project concentrated on detecting sub-millimeter galaxies in the AzTEC/COSMOS field and he will be presenting this work at the winter 2011 AAS meeting."

  Duke = "<b>Adam D. Siegel : </b>The club Vice President is a senior, double majoring in Physics and Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Astronomy. His current research project is on computational hydrodynamics and nuclear flame physics, under the guidance of Professors Mike Zingale and Alan Calder. This project involves helping write and running numerical simulations to understand the pre-explosive phases of type Ia supernovae, as well as defeating Sith Lords on daily basis. He plans to pursue a PhD in the field of computational science and simulation."
  Mobius = "<b>Shannon Hicks : </b>The club Treasurer iscurrently a Junior, pursuing a double major in Astronomy and Physics. She is also pursuing research on Peculiar Brown Dwarfs with Professor Stan Metchev. She has also done various other work with Photometry and Comet Detection at Brookhaven National Lab and the Naval Research Lab during the summers of 2009 and 2010. She plans to continue doing research with Prof. Metchev throughout the year, and hopefully do another REU project over the summer. After graduating from Stony Brook, she plans to get a PhD. in some field of astronomy that has yet to be determined."
  BK = "<b>Jonathan Ullman : </b>The club Secretary is currently a senior looking to complete a major in astronomy. Although he is not currently conducting research, he plans to start a project with one of the faculty over the course of the next year. He also planes to spend this summer (and hopefully the rest of his summers) travelling the world and stargazing!"
