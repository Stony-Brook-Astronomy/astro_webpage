That the known stars with lowest mass lie nearest the Sun is a selection effect attributable to their low luminosity.

Taken in 2007, this is the earliest detection of all three planets in the so far only directly imaged multi-planet system.  Combined with more recent images taken in 2008 and 2009, these data clearly demonstrate the orbital motions of all three planets.  Planets b, c, and d revolve around HR 8799 along nearly face-on oriented orbits, at separations of 68, 37, and 24 AU, respectively, with corresponding orbital periods of approximately 450 years, 190 years, and 98 years.  Each planet is about 100,000 times fainter than HR 8799 (which has been masked out); the projected angular separations between the planets and the star are 0.6-1.7 arc seconds."

After a few hours of aligning the telescope, and calibrating the CCD, they took this image of M42 (The Great Orion Nebula).  This image is created by taking multiple exposures of the nebula in 3 different filters, normalizing them, and combining them to create a false color image.  The colors in the image are comprised by three filters, Hydrogen alpha for red, V for green, and B for blue.";
