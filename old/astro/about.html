    <p>The Astronomy program at Stony Brook was formed in 1968 as part
    of the Department of Earth and Space Sciences and administratively
    moved in 1998 to what is now the <A
    HREF="http://physics.sunysb.edu">Department of Physics and
    Astronomy</A>. Since its inception, the program has expanded into
    broad areas of galactic and extragalactic astronomy, nuclear
    astrophysics, stellar astrophysics, and cosmology. It offers
    strong undergraduate programs leading to the baccalaureate and
    graduate programs leading to the Master of Science and Doctor of
    Philosophy.

    <p>Currently, the program has eight full-time astronomy faculty,
    several adjunct/research/emeritus faculty, two postdoctoral
    researchers, and numerous graduate and undergraduate student
    researchers.  The faculty has developed a significant diversity of
    interests, has earned an international reputation, and can provide
    students with opportunities for study and research in many fields.

    <p>Courses taken by undergraduate Astronomy majors are
    characterized by their small size
    and their intimate character. Instruction and learning take place
    in nearly optimal circumstances. Graduates of the program go on to
    the best graduate programs or are very competitive for techical
    positions in industry.
