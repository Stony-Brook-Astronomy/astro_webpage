    <blockquote><blockquote>
	<font size="+1">
	<p>A correlation between the radial velocity variations and
	line bisector slope changes in late-type stars implicates large
	starspots rather than a low-mass companion.  Two young stars,
	and recent results in the literature, demonstrate that the
	absence of this correlation is insufficient to rule out
	starspots.  As part of our survey for substellar companions to
	T Tauri stars, we identified the ~2 Myr old planet host
	candidates DN Tau and V836 Tau.  In both cases, visible light
	radial velocity modulation appears periodic and is uncorrelated
	with line bisector span variations, suggesting close companions
	of several Jupiter masses in these systems.  However,
	high-resolution, infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that these
	radial velocity variations arise in starspots.  Observations of
	another young star, V827 Tau, are unambiguous: it is identified
	as a spotted star on the basis of both visible light and
	infrared spectroscopy.  These results suggest that infrared
	follow up observations are critical for determining the source
	of radial velocity modulation in young, spotted stars.  I will
	highlight recent observations of a promising ~2 Myr exoplanet
	host candidate which manifests a similar radial velocity period
	and amplitude in both visible and infrared light.
