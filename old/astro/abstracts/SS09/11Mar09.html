      Title : The Origin of Brown Dwarfs<br>
      Speaker : Kevin Luhman, Penn State University
    </center></b></font>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>The origin of brown dwarfs is a mystery because standard theories
      of star formation cannot easily create objects at such low masses.
      I will review the current state of observational and theoretical
      work on understanding how brown dwarfs form. I will first describe the
      latest measurements of various properties of brown dwarfs, including
      their initial mass function, binarity, circumstellar environment
      (disks, accretion, envelopes), and spatial and velocity distributions
      at birth, and I will then compare these data to the predictions of
      theories for the formation of brown dwarfs.
