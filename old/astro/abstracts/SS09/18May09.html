      Title : Lessons Learned from the Infrared, and Future Prospects for
      Studies of Nearby Galaxies<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">

    <p>I will review recent results, and the lessons learned from them,
    on the properties of star formation in nearby galaxies, using
    multi-wavelength datasets, from the ultraviolet (GALEX) to the
    infrared (Spitzer). I will place these results in the context of
    future developments in the field, where the exploitation of
    upcoming facilities, including Herschel, the Large Millimeter
    Telescope, and ALMA will be key to address a number of unsolved
    issues.
