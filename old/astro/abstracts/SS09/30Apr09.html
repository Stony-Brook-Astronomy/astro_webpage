Title : The Role of Gas in the Evolution of Early Type Galaxies<br>
Speaker : Jennifer Donovan, Columbia University
    </center></b></font>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>Between z~1 and the present day, the stellar masses of early
    type galaxies have doubled, and since z~2, their physical sizes
    have increased by at least the same factor. Recent work has
    addressed the viability of dry, or dissipationless, mergers to
    explain this evolution in mass and size.  However, many local field
    early type galaxies are rich in neutral gas, and ultraviolet colors
    indicate that many of these systems contain a significant component
    of recently formed stars. I will address a set of optical criteria
    which have been used to select dry mergers, describe some
    conditions under which early types turn their gas into stars, and
    explore how common this phenomenon is.
