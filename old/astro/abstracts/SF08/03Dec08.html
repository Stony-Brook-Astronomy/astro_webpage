      Title : Great catches in hunt for exoplanets: the
      first direct images!<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
	<font size="+1">
	<p>Since the historic discovery of 51 Peg b in 1995, over 300
	  exoplanets have been discovered, indirectly, through the
	  subtle effects that they induce on their parent stars. These
	  discoveries have revealed an unexpected diversity of
	  &#147;exo-worlds&#148; and brought forth crucial information
	  to advance our understanding of how planets form and evolve
	  around stars. The picture remains incomplete, however, as
	  planets on orbits the size of our solar system or larger
	  cannot be detected using these indirect techniques, and
	  accurate characterization of planets found in this manner is
	  very difficult. Direct imaging detection is currently our
	  only means to complete the picture, and would offer new
	  possibilities to characterize the planets in more details.
	  Fortunately, huge first steps in this direction have just
	  been made, with the direct imaging detections of a distant
	  planetary mass candidate companion to a very young star in
	  Upper Scorpius, three massive planets in orbit around the
	  young star HR 8799, and a planet orbiting inside the dust
	  belt of the bright star Fomalhaut. In this talk I will review
	  each of these discoveries and briefly discuss their potential
	  impact on our understanding of planet formation.
