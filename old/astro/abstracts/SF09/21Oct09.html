    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>I report on recent investigations into the properties of
    low-mass stars observed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
    (SDSS). Low-mass stars, with masses less than 0.8 Solar masses,
    comprise about 70% of all stars, and have lifetimes much longer
    than the age of the Universe. This ubiquity and longevity make
    them ideal tracers of local Milky Way structure and
    kinematics. Using the largest spectroscopic and photometric
    samples of these stars ever constructed, we have pursued new
    statistical investigations into the properties of these stars,
    including their luminosity and mass functions and kinematic
    signatures.
