    <p>In the last 15 years, astronomers have found almost 400 planets
    orbiting stars other than our Sun. These extra-solar planets have
    a remarkable diversity of orbital and physical properties, many
    unlike planets in our own solar system. Even in this exotic
    menagerie, close-in extra-solar planets stand out as unusual and
    puzzling. These planets have masses ranging from several Earth
    masses to many Jupiter masses, but orbits that are at least 10
    times closer to their host stars than the Earth is to the
    Sun. Because they are the easiest planets to detect, close-in
    planets provide much of our current information about physical and
    orbital properties of extra-solar planets, so understanding their
    mysterious origin and evolution is important for understanding
    planets in general.  Within such proximity to their host stars,
    close-in planets are especially susceptible to the effects of
    tides. Tidal deformation of the planets by their host stars and of
    the host stars by their planets can affect the planets' orbital
    and thermal evolution. For example, tides can circularize orbits
    and cause them to decay. In many cases, tides may have already
    destroyed many close-in planets by causing them to crash into
    their host stars.  As tides change the orbits of these planets,
    they can also heat their interiors. This heating may cause gaseous
    planets to become inflated, or may drive vigorous volcanism on
    rocky planets, as on Jupiter's moon Io. Tides can also help strip
    the atmospheres from gas giant planets that wander too close to
    their host stars. In fact, there are indications that the first
    unambiguously rocky extra-solar planet discovered, CoRoT-7 b, may
    actually be the remnant rocky core of a tidally stripped gaseous
    planet. In this talk, I will discuss our rapidly evolving
    knowledge of close-in extra-solar planets, and highlight the
    important and complex role played by tides.
