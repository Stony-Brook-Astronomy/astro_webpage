Title : "Dense Molecular Gas and Modes of Massive Star (Cluster) Formation in
Galaxies"<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>Starbursts may proceed in the formation of super star clusters
    (SSCs).  And most SSCs might have formed out of the clumps of
    dense cores associated with the complexes of the giant molecular
    clouds (GMCs). CO traces bulk of the molecular gas, but not the
    dense clumps of GMC cores where gas density is more than two
    orders of magnitude higher than the average. High-dipole moment
    molecules such as HCN trace much denser molecular gas and strongly
    correlate with the far-infrared (FIR) emission for essential all
    star-forming systems near and far. Such a tight lin- ear FIR-HCN
    correlation demonstrates that the star formation rate depends
    linearly upon the mass of dense molecular gas and the GMC cores
    might be the ba- sic units for massive star formation in
    galaxies. The enormous order-of-magnitude increases in both the
    spatial resolution and sensitivity of the ALMA will revolutionize
    our understanding of the formation of massive stars/SSCs and dense
    clumps of molecular gas by revealing many such dense clumps of the
    GMC cores in nearby starburst systems, reminiscent of the abundant
    SSCs discovered by the HST in starburst galaxies such as the
    Antennae galaxies.
