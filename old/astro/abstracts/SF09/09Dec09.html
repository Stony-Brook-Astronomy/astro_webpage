    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>The origin and evolution of brown dwarfs remain a fundamental
    open question.  For open clusters at different ages and
    environments the initial/present mass function is one of the main
    observational signatures which can be used to investigate this
    question. Here I will present my work on IC2391 and the Praesepe
    open clusters, including some ongoing projects. From our radial
    survey of the stellar and substellar population of IC2391 (age ~
    50 myr), we observe a radial variation in the mass function over
    the range 0.072-0.3Msun, but no significant variation in the mass
    function below the substellar boundary. This lack of radial
    variation for low masses is what we would expect with the ejection
    scenario for brown dwarf formation. In the Praesepe open cluster
    (age ~ 590 Myr), we observe that the mass function of Praesepe
    rises from 0.8Msol down to 0.1Msol and then turns-over at
    ~0.1Msol. The rise observed is in agreement with the mass function
    derived by previous studies, but we observe a significant
    difference with the mass function of the Hyades open cluster.
    This is surprising, since Praesepe and the Hyades share a
    comparable age, size, mass, metallicity and binary fraction.
