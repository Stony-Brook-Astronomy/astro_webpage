Title : "Where to Study Planet Formation? The Nearest, Youngest Stars"<br>
Speaker : Eric Mamajek, University of Rochester
    </center></b></font>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
    <font size="+1">
    <p>The nearest, youngest stars are the best targets for studying
    the early evolution of planetary systems at the highest spatial
    resolution and best sensitivity with modern observatories. In a
    sense, they provide us with our nearest snapshots of what our
    early solar system may have resembled.  I will describe recent
    efforts to find and characterize the nearest, youngest stars in
    the Sun's vicinity, and what recent surveys of protoplanetary
    disks, dusty debris disks, and searches for giant planets at large
    orbital radii appear to be telling us about the planet formation
    process.
