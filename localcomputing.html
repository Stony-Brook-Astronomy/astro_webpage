                By logging into any of the ACF systems, or by using
                them for email, printing, display, or other
                input/output purposes, or maintaining web pages on the
                Astronomy Web Server you are agreeing to the following
                terms of usage for these machines:
                <ul class="style">
                  <li> You agree that the System Manager will have
                    full access to all files and data on the public
                    machines and have the right to remove any and all
                    files which are in conflict with this usage policy
                    for these systems, or which compromise the the
                    security and operability of the public systems.</li>

                  <li> You agree that your usage of the machines may
                    be monitored for the purposes of security and
                    maintenance of the operating status of these
                    machines. This includes, but is not limited to, the
                    monitoring of data transmitted over the Internet,
                    data found on storage subsystems, web pages, and
                    keystrokes. You agree that you have no legal
                    expectation of privacy on these machines.</li>

                  <li> You agree that these machines are to be used
                    for University and Research Foundation related
                    business and scholarly activity only. All other
                    usage is prohibited.</li>

                  <li> You agree to utilize all ACF equipment in a
                    manner that will minimize security risks to the
                    systems and to minimize inconvenience to other
                    users of the systems. This includes, but is not
                    limited to, maintaining password security and
                    complying with security policies established by
                    the System Manager and the Astronomy Computer
                    Committee.</li>

                  <li> You agree to follow the instructions of the
                    System Manager and the Astronomy Computer
                    Committee regarding the use of these systems.</li>

                  <li> You agree that the usage of these systems also
                    must conform to the all University policies including
                    the University Policy on the Responsible Use of
                    Information Technology.</li>
                  <li> You agree to be responsible for maintaining a
                    current awareness of these Terms of Usage, as well
                    as the University Usage Policy, both of which may
                    change at any time.</li>
                  <li> You agree that backup of your files is solely
                    your responsibility.</li>
                </ul>

                Usage of the ACF in a manner that conflicts with the
                aforementioned terms will be grounds for suspension of
                all access to the system at the discretion of the
                System Manager and/or the Astronomy Computer
                Committee. Further review of any suspensions by the
                Astronomy Computer Committee may result in permanent
                termination of access to these systems.

                These "Terms of Usage" have been approved by the
                Astronomy Computer Committee.
